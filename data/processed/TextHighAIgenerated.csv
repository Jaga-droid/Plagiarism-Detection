0,"Tony Blair has expressed his apologies to two families who were victims of a major miscarriage of justice in the UK. The prime minister addressed the wrongful imprisonment of 11 individuals for IRA bombings at pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr. Blair conveyed his regret, stating, ""I deeply regret the suffering and injustice they endured."" The apology was delivered to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in a private setting at Westminster. In a televised statement, Mr. Blair emphasized that the families should receive full and public exoneration."
1,"The families had been anticipating the apology to be delivered during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. However, Gerry Conlon, one of the Guildford Four wrongly convicted of planting the bombs, expressed the families' joy over the apology. Conlon mentioned that Mr. Blair's apology was delivered with great sincerity and exceeded their expectations, as he took the time to listen to everyone and showed genuine emotion. Conlon praised Blair for bridging divides and helping to mend old wounds, a day he never thought would come. The apology came after a significant campaign in Ireland for a public apology following the"
2,"She stated that those who had doubts about our innocence should now be convinced that we were completely innocent. They had been imprisoned for dealing with explosives, but the scientific evidence used against them was later proven to be false. The Court of Appeal overturned the sentences of the Guildford Four in October 1989 and the Maguire Seven in June 1991. The case of Mr. Conlon was featured in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, with Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role."
3,"The Tories have accused Labour of reneging on their pre-election immigration promise even before their new pledge card has been finalized. Home Secretary Charles Clarke reportedly expressed a desire for increased migration to the UK to Labour members. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox criticized Clarke's comments, noting a contradiction with Tony Blair's forecast of reduced immigration. In response, Clarke dismissed Fox's accusations as an attempt to gain political advantage by conflating immigration with asylum."
4,"According to London's Evening Standard, Mr. Clarke expressed his desire for Britain to provide sanctuary to those escaping tyranny during a question and answer session with Labour activists in Gateshead. He emphasized that offering refuge is not only a moral and legal obligation but also a fundamental aspect of the country's identity. Mr. Clarke stated that the country welcomes more migration for study and work purposes, as well as for those seeking refuge. When asked about the impact of the government's new immigration plans on net migration, Mr. Blair assured MPs that the measures would eliminate abuse and likely reduce numbers due to the end of chain"
5,"Dr Fox criticized the prime minister for repeatedly breaking promises, noting that even the Labour Party's vague election pledges don't last long. The Tories are pushing for quotas for economic migrants and refugees, with plans to reveal more details on health checks for migrants on Tuesday. Mr Clarke dismissed the Tory attack as an attempt to gain political advantage, accusing them of conflating immigration and asylum issues."
6,"Mr Clarke emphasized that the UK would welcome genuine economic migrants for essential roles through a strict points-based system. Only asylum seekers truly escaping death or persecution would be allowed entry. He stated, ""We anticipate a decrease in unfounded applications under our proposed measures."" Dr Fox previously accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet members of spreading falsehoods about Tory policies and then criticizing those falsehoods. He remarked on BBC Radio, ""If you are willing to deceive about the reasons for engaging in war, it's likely you will deceive about anything."" The recent disagreements before the election arose when Mr Blair informed Labour members that the"
7,"Public trust in taxes is deteriorating because Labour and Tories are not being honest with people on the matter, according to Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy. In a speech delivered a day before the government's pre-Budget report, Mr. Kennedy stated that his party was acknowledging the ""painful economic realities."" He expressed that the current tax level was appropriate, although he proposed a new 50% tax for high earners. Other parties have criticized the Lib Dems for making promises without proper costings. Mr. Kennedy emphasized his commitment to addressing this criticism, noting that the Lib Dems have already disclosed the full cost"
8,"During his speech at the Commonwealth Club, Mr. Kennedy emphasized the importance of a political party maintaining economic credibility by fulfilling its promises and meeting expectations. He stressed the necessity for budgets to be balanced and for tough decisions to be made regarding public spending. The Liberal Democrats proposed cutting expenses deemed as ""low priority,"" such as the government's ID cards scheme and the Child Trust Fund, in order to reallocate funds towards enhancing basic state pensions for individuals over the age of 75, increasing police presence, and reintroducing free eye and dental check-ups. The party has been transparent about their tax policies, previously"
9,"The Liberal Democrats accuse the Conservatives of proposing tax cuts just for publicity, while Labour is keeping most of its tax increases hidden. According to Mr. Kennedy, it is crucial for political parties to be transparent about their plans in order to maintain the trust of the people in fair taxation and responsible spending. He criticized Gordon Brown's stealth tax approach, the unfairness of the current tax system, and the Conservative party's unfulfilled promises on tax issues. Mr. Kennedy called on the Treasury to allow the National Audit Office to assess the government's financial performance. In response, Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox"
10,"Tony Blair has stated that voters will need to wait for Labour's manifesto to see if the party intends to raise taxes. The Prime Minister's comments came in response to a challenge from Conservative leader Michael Howard, who claimed that Labour would increase taxes in its post-election Budget. Mr Blair dismissed Tory assertions that they could slash £35bn in ""wasteful spending,"" arguing that the party had miscalculated. The two political figures clashed shortly after the start of the pre-election period. Mr Howard informed MPs that various independent experts, including the International Monetary Fund and the Institute of Fiscal Studies, had indicated"
11,"Their plans for reduced government borrowing and increased spending on essential services were also outlined. Labour and the Liberal Democrats have criticized the party's financial calculations, arguing that it would result in cuts to frontline services. However, Mr. Howard emphasized that voters would have a clear choice in the upcoming election between more wasteful spending and higher taxes under Labour, or Tory promises of value for money and lower taxes. The Liberal Democrats have also unveiled their pre-election agenda, with leader Charles Kennedy asserting that his party represents the true opposition, particularly on issues such as the Iraq war, council tax, and university tuition fees."
12,"The Conservative Party has decided to support the government's contentious proposal to implement ID cards. The shadow cabinet announced its backing before the upcoming parliamentary vote on a bill mandating the use of ID cards. Despite some senior Tories strongly opposing the idea during a challenging meeting, the party ultimately agreed to support it. The bill, aimed at addressing issues such as crime, terrorism, and illegal immigration, is likely to face opposition from the Liberal Democrats."
13,"According to sources within the Conservative Party who spoke to the BBC, the scheme has been criticized as ""deeply flawed"" and a waste of money. Michael Howard, who has always supported ID cards and attempted to introduce them during his time as Home Secretary, has been in favor of the initiative. The party, which had previously been neutral on the issue, has now decided to take a stance, with a Tory source stating that they are no longer sitting on the fence. Despite endorsing ID cards, the Conservatives have emphasized their intention to hold ministers accountable for the scheme's specific objectives. They have also expressed"
14,"Mark Oaten, the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, expressed his belief that Michael Howard was disregarding his colleagues' worries about ID cards. Oaten urged the Conservative Party to take a stand and attempt to change public opinion rather than simply following it. Guy Mansfield QC, the new chairman of the Bar Council, cautioned that individuals on the fringes of society could be pushed towards extremism. He highlighted the potential consequences for young Asian men in the event of a bombing incident, emphasizing that they could face detention if they do not possess ID cards."
15,"The shadow chancellor emphasized the necessity for a significant shift in direction in Britain to ensure prosperity as the Tory Party spring conference commenced. Oliver Letwin highlighted that the UK's ability to compete with other nations hinged on the proposed £4bn tax cuts. Tory co-chairman Liam Fox criticized Labour's performance at the forum in Brighton, with party leader Michael Howard scheduled to address attendees later. Tony Blair warned that Conservative policies could lead to economic downfall, but Mr Letwin pointed out that Britain had dropped from fourth to 11th place in the global economic competitiveness rankings."
16,"He questioned whether the country can compete and prosper without addressing the regulatory and tax burdens on the economy. Highlighting the importance of reducing regulations and taxes to tackle challenges posed by countries like China and India, he emphasized the need to implement carefully planned strategies to save £12bn by 2007-2008. He criticized Labour for advocating higher taxes, borrowing, and wasteful spending. Dr. Fox also criticized the government's failure to control immigration, asylum, and its performance in the NHS, education, and crime. He promised that a Tory government would address these issues by improving immigration policies, priorit"
17,"Downing Street announced that Britain has proposed sending a group of 120 Gurkhas to support the tsunami relief operations in Indonesia. The deployment would include troops from the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles stationed in Brunei. Talks are underway with Indonesia to finalize the timing and location of the deployment, with the focus on assisting the Aceh province. Additionally, Downing Street mentioned the possibility of extending a similar offer to the Sri Lankan government."
18,"A spokesperson highlighted that Indonesia faced specific logistical challenges that the Gurkhas could potentially assist with. The spokesperson announced that after the morning coordination meeting for post-tsunami relief efforts, the government officially extended an offer to the Indonesian government for the support of a company of British Army Gurkhas from 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles, comprising around 120 personnel and two helicopters. This offer was in addition to the ships and aircraft already committed to the relief operation in the Indian Ocean. Indonesia was significantly impacted by the tsunami, with 94,000 out of the 140,000"
19,"The prime minister, along with Education Secretary Ruth Kelly, took to the waters in a sailing dinghy in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, to promote his party's education policies. Tony Blair emphasized Labour's commitment to education during a visit with parents in the area. The Conservatives and Lib Dems dismissed his promises as ""worthless,"" as all parties gear up for the upcoming General Election expected to take place on 5 May. Mr Blair, looking slightly windswept, joined two students and an instructor from St Egwin's Middle School in Evesham for a sail on the lake, closely"
20,"He later mentioned that outdoor activities were beneficial for children, but acknowledged that many teachers were now hesitant to participate due to concerns about potential lawsuits. Mr. Blair stated that by implementing simple guidelines, teachers could reduce the risk of legal action. He emphasized the importance of using common sense during such activities to prevent unnecessary worries about legal repercussions for parents and teachers. Mr. Blair recently introduced six election pledges, including the promise of improved education with the slogan ""your child achieving more."" If Labour secures a third term in the upcoming general election, they plan to offer parents more school choices, grant specialist status to"
21,"Parents and teachers who had written to their MPs expressing concerns about education were invited to an informal discussion with Mr. Blair on Tuesday. This event is part of a series aimed at demonstrating that the prime minister is engaging directly with voters leading up to the election, and that he remains connected to their concerns. Shadow education secretary Tim Collins of the Conservatives criticized Mr. Blair's government, stating that it is all talk and should be evaluated based on its actions in two terms, not on promises for a third term. The Liberal Democrats have pledged to reduce class sizes for young children and ensure that all subjects are taught"
22,"Archbishop Desmond Tutu has urged for the release of the remaining prisoners at Guantanamo Bay and individuals suspected of terrorism who are being held without trial in the UK. His remarks come after the announcement that all four British detainees at the Cuban facility will be set free in the coming weeks. The South African archbishop expressed his disapproval of detaining individuals without trial, describing it as both ""unacceptable"" and ""distressing."" In the UK, twelve foreign nationals are currently being held indefinitely under anti-terror legislation. Archbishop Tutu criticized the detentions in Cuba, stating to BBC News that such actions"
23,"Moazzam Begg, a resident of Birmingham, along with Martin Mubanga, Richard Belmar, and Feroz Abbasi, who are from London, have been in US custody at Guantanamo Bay for nearly three years. Foreign Secretary Jack Straw informed the Parliament on Tuesday that the US had agreed to release the four individuals following extensive and intricate security discussions. The British citizens were detained in connection with the US-led ""war on terror."" The Archbishop expressed concern about those who remain detained, questioning the acceptability of detaining individuals without trial, similar to past practices in South Africa. Lawyer Louise"
24,"Archbishop Tutu expressed his disapproval of the measures, stating: ""I am against any arbitrary detention, even in Britain."" Shami Chakrabarti, the director of civil rights group Liberty, urged the government to follow through on its principles and either release or charge the detained individuals. However, the Home Office stood by the measures, with a spokesperson explaining: ""These individuals are currently unable to be prosecuted due to the inability to safely disclose certain evidence provided by third parties in criminal proceedings, which could jeopardize others. Additionally, intelligence obtained from covert intercepts cannot be utilized in a legal"
25,"Tory leader Michael Howard has announced that the Conservative Party plans to reduce the number of MPs by approximately 20% if they win the election. This proposal is a key component of the party's upcoming ""smaller government bill,"" which will be revealed later this week. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Mr. Howard also mentioned that the party intends to decrease the number of government special advisers. Additionally, he stated that a referendum would take place in Wales to determine the fate of the Welsh Assembly."
26,"Mr. Howard informed the paper that if the Conservatives won a general election, the changes would occur within five years. The exact number of MPs to be removed would hinge on the outcome of the Welsh referendum, but it would likely result in a decrease of approximately 120 from the current total of 659. Should Wales opt to retain its assembly, it would face a greater loss of MPs. Mr. Howard suggested that both parties should also reduce their own numbers, given their plans to cut civil servants at Whitehall - Labour by over 80,000 and the Tories by nearly 100,000."
27,"Mr Howard emphasized that the plan aimed to address the imbalance in parliamentary representation, particularly the overrepresentation of Scottish and Welsh MPs compared to those from England. He highlighted the differences in constituency sizes, with English constituencies averaging 70,000 people, while Northern Ireland had just over 66,000, Wales just over 59,000, and Scotland 53,000. Mr Howard proposed that the number of Welsh MPs should be adjusted to ensure equitable representation across the United Kingdom if the assembly was eliminated. He stressed the need for swift implementation of these changes, suggesting they could be in place by the"
28,"Ministers are considering the possibility of electronically tagging parents who refuse to allow their former partners to have contact with their children. Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary, mentioned that curfews and community service orders could also be used if court orders for parental access were ignored. He clarified that fathers' activists did not influence the proposed changes, but rather there is a general acknowledgment that something needs to be addressed. Lord Falconer highlighted that around 15,000 to 20,000 couples resort to court for access disputes annually, even though in the majority of separations, court intervention is not necessary"
29,"Parenting plans will provide guidance on visitation schedules, drawing from successful real-life scenarios. In addition, there will be an expansion of in-court mediation, with an emphasis on holding more casual hearings prior to contested court proceedings."
30,"Improved availability of legal, emotional, and practical guidance via phone and online platforms - Modifications to legal aid to encourage prompt resolution of conflicts."
31,"According to a spokesperson, judges have the authority to imprison parents who violate contact orders, but this is considered a last resort and is rarely used due to concerns about the child's well-being. The new legislation aims to introduce a range of penalties, such as fines, community service, anger management or parenting classes, and curfews. Offenders who fail to comply with these measures may be subject to electronic tagging. Lord Falconer suggested that tagging might be excessive, but he encouraged a discussion on the topic. The specifics of the new powers will be disclosed when a bill is published within the next two"
32,"Fathers' rights groups have expressed disapproval of the government's proposals. John Ison of Fathers 4 Justice described the situation as disappointing, citing it as a mere recycling of existing legislation. Jim Parton from Families Need Fathers noted that the new proposals lacked compulsion and suggested that couples should create a plan that could be enforced by a court order to ensure clarity and stability. He mentioned that Children's Minister Margaret Hodge had informed him that there was insufficient time to pass the bill before the upcoming general election in May."
33,"The Conservatives are pushing for a law that mandates an equal split between parents on access. Theresa May, who serves as the shadow secretary for the family, criticized the government's current plans as insufficient and merely covering up the flaws in the system. She emphasized that a Conservative government would introduce significant changes to the family courts, including implementing a legal presumption of co-parenting and mandatory mediation. May stated that the goal is to ensure that courts are the last resort, not the first, and highlighted the importance of avoiding treating children as property in the event of a marriage breakdown. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats advocate"
34,"New regulations regarding marriage for foreign nationals residing in the UK will soon be implemented. Starting from Tuesday, most non-EU citizens will be required to obtain approval from the Home Office before getting married. The Home Office states that the objective of the new rules is to decrease the occurrence of sham marriages, which are estimated to reach up to 15,000 annually. However, the JCWI, a group representing immigrants, argues that the regulations violate human rights laws and is considering a legal challenge. When the changes were announced last year, immigration minister Des Browne emphasized the goal of minimizing disruptions to genuine marriages"
35,"Starting from Tuesday, all non-EU nationals, with the exception of citizens from Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland, or Norway, who plan to marry in the UK must either secure a marriage visa before entering the country or apply for a Home Office 'certificate of marriage approval'. To obtain this certificate, which costs £135, applicants must provide evidence of their legal right to be in the UK. Individuals without settled status, such as asylum seekers awaiting a decision on their application, will not be permitted to marry in the UK. Once they have the required documentation, those under immigration controls who wish to"
36,"In some instances, the Home Secretary may act as a last resort marriage registrar under these rules. Ms. Beynon mentioned that they are seeking legal advice on this matter and will assist individuals whose right to marry has been violated by potentially taking the case to the Human Rights Court. The new regulations have raised concerns with the parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which suggested that the restrictions introduced could be disproportionate and incompatible with the right to marry. The committee also highlighted potential conflicts with the Human Rights Act regarding religion, belief, and nationality. In the past year, there has been an increase in immigration service operations"
37,"Pro-hunt Members of Parliament are criticizing the poorly written new law that prohibits hunting with dogs, as they claim it is so vague that no one can clearly determine what constitutes an offense. This criticism arose when a man from Devon was advised that he could use his four dogs to ""drive away unwanted animals"" from his farm without it being considered hunting, as he had no intention of killing deer or foxes. Liberal Democrat MP Lembit Opik raised concerns about the government creating a new form of hunting called ""chasing away"" and questioned how law enforcement officials were expected to interpret and enforce these unclear"
38,"North Devon landowner Giles Bradshaw reached out to the Middle Way Group, co-chaired by Mr. Opik, after contacting Defra, the rural affairs ministry. He had inquired about the legality of using his four dogs to scare off deer and foxes under the Hunting Act. Initially informed that his technique was prohibited, Mr. Bradshaw raised a complaint. The Middle Way Group also expressed concern that Mr. Bradshaw might be forced to resort to using a rifle to deal with animals he previously deterred with his dogs. However, a subsequent conversation revealed that according to Defra's"
39,"The government is eager to leave behind this failed law, but it is unlikely that the countryside will be willing to cooperate. Mike Hobday from the League Against Cruel Sports stated that there is no confusion, just a matter of common sense. He emphasized that if Mr. Bradshaw's dogs are used to chase wild animals, it constitutes hunting and is a criminal offense. However, if the dogs are simply barking at the deer, it cannot be considered hunting."
40,"The top judge in the UK has disclosed that he has had disagreements with government officials regarding the selection process for heads of public inquiries. Lord Woolf emphasized his commitment to maintaining his authority to veto the appointment of a judge to lead an inquiry as a means of safeguarding judicial independence. However, he informed Members of Parliament that the Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, was adamant that he should have the ultimate decision-making power in these situations. The inquiry conducted by Lord Hutton into the death of Dr. David Kelly triggered discussions about the appropriate individuals to oversee inquiries."
41,"According to the government, it is unlikely that the lord chancellor would oppose the wishes of Lord Woolf, who serves as the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Lord Woolf recently provided testimony to the Commons public administration select committee's investigation into public inquiries. He mentioned that he was not involved in selecting Lord Hutton, a law lord not under his authority. However, he believes he should have the power to veto the appointment of judges to lead specific inquiries and determine which judge should be chosen. In a written statement to the committee, Lord Woolf expressed his ongoing disagreement with the lord chancellor on"
42,"Lord Woolf expressed that although the current rules were not formally documented, it was highly unlikely that the lord chancellor would disregard his concerns in reality. However, he noted that this dynamic could shift with upcoming legal reforms. The matter arose when a new agreement was being drafted regarding responsibilities, leading to a dispute in subsequent discussions. Lord Woolf emphasized the importance of ensuring that if he did not agree with the lord chancellor on appointing a judge, the appointment should not proceed. While he believed there would be no significant obstacles, he aimed to establish this fundamental principle. A spokesperson from the Department for Constitutional Affairs"
43,"This week, the Vote For Me talent contest, inspired by ITV1's Pop Idol, will be airing on our screens. Over the next four days, numerous aspiring politicians will be evaluated by a panel of experts and the public vote. The victorious candidate will be urged to run as an independent in the upcoming general election, anticipated in the spring. However, there is disagreement on whether the current crop of candidates possess the necessary qualities to succeed in politics. Former independent MP Martin Bell asserted on BBC Radio 4's Today program that all of them could serve as competent MPs."
44,"Mr Bell, who will be providing guidance to the contestants on Wednesday, believes that Westminster has its fair share of unconventional individuals and that the show will attract regular voters. ""If it encourages more people to vote and take an interest in politics, then there's no harm in that,"" he stated. However, Sir Bernard Ingham, former press secretary to Margaret Thatcher, had a less favorable opinion, accusing the program of ""corrupting politics."" He doubted that the producers would succeed in re-engaging voters ""with that group of eccentric individuals."" To be fair to Sir Bernard, the opening episode"
45,"The participants had 60 seconds to present their manifestos, followed by a test of the final 25's lobbying skills. They were then questioned by the panel, led by ex-ITN political editor John Sergeant, with TV host Lorraine Kelly in the Nicki Chapman role. However, the standout personality was Kelvin MacKenzie, who occupied the Simon Cowell, Mr Nasty position. The former Sun editor delivered a series of clever insults and witty remarks. For instance, he advised one contestant to ""get a haircut and a brain transplant."" Wheelchair user Kevin Donnellon was questioned"
46,"Mr Lim amused the panel by proposing a plan to have people do community service instead of paying taxes. During a discussion about the country's finances, Mr MacKenzie highlighted the potential chaos if taxes were not collected due to everyone painting houses but not paying taxes. Mr Lim, feeling disheartened, struggled to contribute to the conversation. Despite some controversial remarks from Mr MacKenzie, Irfan Hanif impressed the panel. Dominic Carman, advocating for cutting defense spending to invest in education, advanced to the final 25. Rodney Hylton-Potts, a convicted fraudster with strong"
47,"Tony Blair does not consider abortion to be a topic for election debate, stating that it is a personal matter of conscience. The prime minister's spokesperson explained Mr. Blair's position after the highest-ranking Catholic in England and Wales supported Michael Howard's position on abortion. The Conservative leader advocates for lowering the legal limit from 24 weeks to 20, criticizing the current regulations as being too lenient. Mr. Blair has affirmed that there are no intentions to amend the existing law."
48,"According to Mr Blair's spokesperson, the Catholic church has a well-known stance on the issue, which was just one of many topics mentioned by the Cardinal and should be considered in that context. Cardinal Cormac Murphy O'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster, supported Mr Howard's position and distanced himself from the Labour party. He emphasized that abortion is a significant issue and endorsed the policy backed by Mr Howard as a step towards completely abandoning abortion. Cardinal O'Connor criticized Labour for assuming it was the natural choice for Catholics, stating that they do not endorse any specific party. The Family Planning Association warned that a"
49,"During an interview with Cosmopolitan, Mr. Howard expressed his belief that abortion should be accessible to all individuals, but he suggested that the law should be amended. He mentioned that in the past, he supported a restriction up to 22 weeks and would be willing to lower it to 20 weeks. All major political parties agree that the abortion issue should be left to the conscience of each Member of Parliament rather than being dictated by party-wide policies. Mr. Howard emphasized that his opinions were personal. Shadow home secretary David Davis indicated that Mr. Howard's comments hinted at the possibility of a Conservative government"
50,"The Conservatives have revealed plans to eliminate 162 quangos as part of their initiative to demonstrate how government bureaucracy can be reduced. Additionally, six government units are set to be abolished under the proposals, which the Tories claim will result in savings exceeding £4.3bn. The targets include strategic health authorities and the recently established fair access regulator for universities. According to Tory frontbencher John Redwood, a leaner government and reduced taxes are essential for Britain to remain competitive."
51,"The proposals aim to eliminate regional assemblies and other regional bodies, such as boards dealing with industrial development and housing. Their authority would be transferred back to elected local councils or the national government. The Conservative Party believes that strategic health authorities are unnecessary, advocating for local residents to oversee hospitals and surgeries instead of officials. John Redwood, in announcing the plans, criticized Tony Blair for neglecting taxpayers' interests and failing to fulfill his promises. He argued that investing in quangos has only resulted in more bureaucrats, increased regulation, and higher taxes, rather than enhancing public services. Party leader Michael Howard emphasized the"
52,"The government has revealed intentions to reduce the number of civil servants by 100,000 as a way to improve efficiency. However, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Paul Boateng criticized the Conservative Party's proposal. Boateng stated, ""The Tories aim to slash Labour's public spending plans by a significant £35 billion. Such substantial cuts cannot be achieved solely by reducing bureaucracy, but would necessitate major reductions in essential public services like schools, hospitals, and law enforcement."" In contrast, the Liberal Democrats have proposed streamlining Whitehall departments to ensure that funds are directed towards frontline services."
53,"The Labour Party has officially announced that its 2006 autumn conference will take place in Manchester instead of Blackpool. This decision, which had been widely anticipated, was approved by Labour's National Executive Committee, marking a departure from the usual selection of a seaside location. This will be the first time since 1917 that Manchester has been chosen as the host city for the party's annual event. As a gesture of goodwill, Blackpool will host the smaller February spring conference."
54,"For years, the main political parties have taken turns holding their annual conferences in Blackpool, Bournemouth, and Brighton. The decision to not have the larger conference in Blackpool this year will be disappointing for the coastal resort. Despite previously stating they would not return to Blackpool, the party did so in 2002 after hosting the event in Bournemouth the year before. Following a two-year deal, Brighton was chosen to host the autumn conference. Colin Asplin from the Blackpool Hotel Association expressed disappointment, saying they had made efforts to bring the conference back to Blackpool but were unsuccessful."
55,"One of Labour's senior Asian members, Shahid Malik, rejected a proposal for ethnic minority shortlists to increase the number of black and Asian MPs. Malik, who sits on Labour's ruling NEC, acknowledged people's frustration but suggested using targets instead of lists to enhance minority representation. Currently, only 13 out of Britain's 659 MPs are from ethnic minority backgrounds. Trevor Phillips, the chief of the Commission for Racial Equality, advocated for such shortlists, emphasizing the need for change. This discussion arose after it was revealed that West Ham, one of Britain's most diverse constituencies, would"
56,"Mr Phillips suggested that changes to race relations legislation could potentially allow political parties to reserve seats for under-represented groups, such as women and minorities in areas like West Ham. He emphasized the need for increased minority representation in politics, stating that if minorities are not adequately represented after years of discussion, a new approach must be taken. Mr Malik, a candidate for Dewsbury, acknowledged the shortcomings of women-only shortlists in promoting ethnic minority candidates but proposed setting targets to make democratic structures more inclusive. Labour MP Diane Abbot supported the idea of shortlists to address the slow progress in electing black"
57,"The Green Party is worried that numerous residents in Edinburgh might not have the opportunity to participate in the transport referendum due to concerns raised by Green MSP Mark Ballard. The Edinburgh City Council plans to conduct a ballot among constituents regarding the implementation of congestion charging in the city. However, there is a fear that individuals who are not included in the council's edited electoral register may be excluded from voting. As per regulations, local authorities are only allowed to send ballot papers to individuals listed on the edited register for non-statutory matters like the transport referendum. Consequently, residents who have chosen to have their information excluded from the"
58,"Nevertheless, individuals not included in the list still have the opportunity to reach out to the council to ensure they receive ballot forms before the voting deadline in February. According to Mr. Ballard, the upcoming vote will shape the future of transportation in Edinburgh for years to come. It is crucial that as many residents in Edinburgh City and the neighboring areas as possible are registered to participate in the ballot. Many individuals may not realize that they could miss the chance to voice their opinion. All stakeholders in the discussion, regardless of their stance, aim for a fair and inclusive ballot, emphasizing the importance of encouraging participation. The"
59,"The Liberal Democrats are making efforts to attract female voters by introducing their manifesto for women. Charles Kennedy is promising a maternity income guarantee and a pension system that considers years of residence instead of national insurance payments. He believes that women will support proposals to abolish university tuition fees and provide free long-term care for the elderly. Both Labour and the Conservatives have also expressed intentions to enhance pensions and childcare support. Mr. Kennedy aims to address policy areas that put women at a disadvantage. ""Currently, two million pensioners in Britain are living below the government's poverty line, with two-thirds of them being women,"" he"
60,"He argues that traditional pensions, which are based on years worked, fail to recognize the valuable contribution women make in caring for children. Mr. Kennedy suggests that the Lib Dem's Citizen's Pension, which is determined by length of residency rather than national insurance contributions, could help rectify this issue. As part of this proposal, new mothers would receive a minimum guaranteed maternity pay of £170 per week for the first six months after the birth of their first child. Additionally, Mr. Kennedy believes that reallocating funds saved from not implementing ""illiberal"" ID cards to increase police numbers by 10"
61,"Party strategists believe that attracting a significant number of female voters is crucial for achieving success in elections. A party spokesperson stated that they are actively seeking the support of women voters because they are more likely to vote than men and are perceived to be more thoughtful and open-minded when choosing who to vote for. Labour's deputy minister for women, Jacqui Smith, criticized the Liberal Democrats for making ""empty promises"" to women and claimed that their proposals would result in a substantial increase in public spending, which would ultimately burden hard-working families through higher taxes or reduced funding for public services. The Labour party has pledged"
62,"Tory leader Michael Howard has taken a proactive stance in response to criticism about how a child of immigrants can advocate for asylum quotas. Mr. Howard, whose parents sought refuge in the UK from the Nazi threat, argues that such a claim would prevent anyone from an immigrant background from becoming prime minister. These remarks were made during a BBC documentary titled 'No More Mr Nasty'. TV host Anne Robinson commented that during his time as home secretary, Mr. Howard seemed to have a harsh demeanor. Robinson, who is a friend of the Tory leader, also shared that during his time at Cambridge, Mr."
63,"Documentary filmmaker Michael Cockerell was granted exclusive access to Mr. Howard for his film portrait. During the interview, the Tory leader was questioned about how he would respond to those suggesting that if there had been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents may not have been permitted to enter the country. In reply, he questioned the implication of such a statement, stating, ""Are you suggesting that individuals with immigrant backgrounds are not entitled to express their views on immigration control for the benefit of the nation? This notion appears quite extraordinary to me. If this were the case"
64,"Ms Robinson, the host of The Weakest Link, expressed her dismay to Cockerell about his tough image during his time as home secretary in John Major's government. She mentioned how he would come across as someone who would mistreat animals or put babies in prison when he appeared on television. She described his approach as very harsh. In the documentary, Mr Howard is seen enjoying Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, finding it amusing despite the false suggestion that he wants fewer black people in the UK.

66,"The lord chancellor denied that the concessions made on the bill, which critics argue could lead to euthanasia being permitted indirectly, were a political maneuver. Amid chaotic scenes in the Commons on Tuesday, ministers have been accused of acting hastily in making last-minute adjustments to the Mental Capacity Bill. Lord Falconer acknowledged that criticism regarding the timing of the changes was valid. He stated that the modifications offered a resolution to a challenging issue, although some Members of Parliament contend that the situation remains ambiguous."
67,"The bill enables individuals to grant someone power of attorney to make decisions on their behalf in case they are unable to do so due to illness. Government officials affirm that the proposed measures will not impact euthanasia laws and will enhance protections. Critics are concerned that the bill could potentially lead to ""killing by omission"" by withholding treatment, such as food and fluids. Tony Blair has pledged to address any worries regarding the bill, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the legal precedent established in the case of Tony Bland, where doctors were permitted to withdraw artificial feeding and hydration. Blair stressed the need to prevent confusion"
68,"On Tuesday, the government successfully defeated a backbench attempt to amend the bill with a vote of 297 to 203, despite 34 Labour MPs rebelling. The rebellion was somewhat quelled by the news that Lord Falconer had assured the Catholic archbishop of Cardiff of strengthening safeguards in the bill. However, this assurance only came after MPs pressured Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy to read the letter, as they felt uninformed. Lammy was handed the letter to read just five minutes before the crucial votes, leading to accusations of disorganization. The deputy speaker later admitted that the debate had not"
69,"The attorney general refuted claims that his statement to Parliament regarding the legality of the Iraq war was prepared by Downing Street officials. Lord Goldsmith clarified that Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan were not involved in crafting the response. He emphasized that the statement reflected his own belief in the war's legality, but did not summarize his advice to the Prime Minister. The government has declined requests to release the complete advice, citing the standard practice of maintaining confidentiality for such documents."
70,"Lord Goldsmith stated that he was actively involved in the drafting process of the answer and personally finalized and approved it. The answer was prepared in his office with the participation of Solicitor General Harriet Harman, two of his officials, three Foreign Office officials, a QC, Christopher Greenwood, and the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg. He clarified that no other minister or official was involved in any way. Lord Goldsmith dismissed the claim that Lord Falconer and Lady Morgan had drafted the answer, attributing it to a mis-transcription of his evidence to the Butler Inquiry. He reiterated"
71,"Previously, Tony Blair disregarded inquiries regarding the attorney general's advice and stated that his statement in Parliament accurately reflected his opinion. ""That's what he (Lord Goldsmith) said and that's what I am saying. He has addressed this issue repeatedly,"" Mr. Blair stated during his monthly press conference at Downing Street. He declined to respond to further questions on the matter.

Sands also revealed that Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair on 7 March 2003 that the Iraq war could be illegal without a second UN resolution authorizing military action.

The Act will grant individuals the authority to request information from various public entities, including government departments and medical facilities. However, an all-party committee expressed doubts about the readiness of many of these bodies, citing a lack of consistent leadership from the Department for Constitutional Affairs."
74,"The legislation will be enforced in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland starting on 1 January, while similar measures are being introduced simultaneously in Scotland. This Act grants the public access to information held by approximately 100,000 public bodies, with certain exceptions. However, the government department in charge of implementing the changes experienced a significant turnover of staff, which severely impacted its operations, according to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee. Despite four years of preparation, some local authorities and parts of the healthcare sector were still unprepared.

Some experts credit him with playing a significant role in Bill Clinton's remarkable comeback victory in 1992. Despite his involvement with various Republicans, as well as politicians in countries like Mexico and Uruguay, Morris is not tied to any particular ideology. He is currently in London, serving as a strategic asset for the UK Independence Party, having recently returned from Ukraine where he assisted opposition candidate Viktor Yushchenko. Critics often point out Morris's tendency to change sides frequently, suggesting that he prioritizes the thrill of"

Morris seems almost passionate about this topic. ""I happened to be on a cruise in the Mediterranean at the same time as UKIP leader Roger Knapman."" ""I had just written an article stating that the English Channel is now wider than the Atlantic, which he appreciated, and our conversation started from there."" But what is it about UKIP that specifically appeals to him? Some may believe it is just another opportunity for him to showcase his skills"
77,"He is determined to assist UKIP in leading Britain out of this organization, which he views as unchangeable and fundamentally undemocratic. He strongly criticizes the Tory party, which he also believes is unchangeable. He describes the Tory party's stance on Europe as contradictory, stating that they cannot renegotiate anything until they commit to leaving the EU, similar to entering a liquor store with a gun but clarifying that no harm will be done. The EU's goal of political integration is to shift decision-making power away from Britain, a position that UKIP opposes and believes the Tories cannot be"
78,"Not only was the shift in power from the Tories a factor, but UKIP also played a significant role in influencing Tony Blair's decision to hold a referendum on the European constitution and in his choice to stay out of the euro. Regarding Robert Kilroy-Silk, Mr. Morris criticizes him for not being a team player and emphasizes the importance of the party standing for something rather than someone. The strategy for the upcoming general election involves focusing on swing seats to secure a significant presence in the Commons, rather than aiming to form the next government or contesting every seat. The potential impact of the internet"
79,"He implies that this could result in a hung parliament where UKIP and other parties could have significant influence. It is certainly a daunting challenge. However, there is a feeling that the upcoming general election might bring unexpected outcomes, despite the prevailing belief that it is likely to be won by Labour. The surprising performance of UKIP in the previous year's European elections serves as evidence of this potential shift, supporting Mr. Morris's argument about a new political consensus. Additionally, considering his established reputation, there is credibility to his perspective."
80,Tony Blair has promised not to criticize Tory leader Michael Howard for his Jewish beliefs. The prime minister clarified that his attacks on Howard are purely political. Blair also made it clear that the recent Labour campaign posters featuring Howard were not meant to be offensive to the Jewish community.
81,"One poster showed Mr. Howard and his shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin, who is also Jewish, depicted as flying pigs. Another image featured the Tory leader swinging a pocket watch on a chain, which critics said resembled the Jewish money lender Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. Some compared the portrayal to the character Fagin in Charles Dickens' Oliver Twist. Labour has since removed these designs from its website, stating that members had preferred other designs. In an interview with the Jewish Chronicle, Mr. Blair emphasized his strong support for the Jewish community and Israel, stating that he would always be a"

He emphasized that Labour actively combated all forms of racism. The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats declined to comment on Mr Blair's remarks.

The 43-year-old politician expressed to the Daily Telegraph that he now considers a life centered around politics to be dull and unsatisfying. Despite stepping down following his party's defeat in the 2001 election, Mr. Hague has not ruled out a potential return to the front bench. Additionally, he mentioned his intention to continue serving as the MP for Richmond, North Yorkshire, and hopes to start a family with his wife Ffion."
84,"In an interview with the newspaper, he expressed uncertainty about returning to the front line but requested not to be rushed. When asked about standing for leadership again, he firmly stated that he would not. Some senior Conservative members, who believe the party needs him, will be disappointed by his decision to stay away from a central role. Shadow education secretary Tim Collins recently mentioned that it would greatly benefit the party if he rejoined the front bench. Having started his political career at 27 and becoming Leader of the Opposition at 36, he considers himself fortunate to have achieved so much by the age of 40"

The environment select committee expressed concerns that the poorly worded draft animal welfare bill could inadvertently lead to anglers being taken to court, despite this not being the intention.

They emphasized the need to address complex and emotional issues raised in the legislation."
86,"They demanded a firm assurance that the government would seek input on any proposals to regulate animal industries such as pet fairs and game bird rearing. The proposed legislation aims to update and enhance animal welfare laws, with a focus on safeguarding both ""kept animals"" and ""companion"" animals through the establishment of a ""duty of care"". Alongside the current cruelty offenses, the bill introduces a new offense of neglect for keepers who fail to adequately care for the animals under their charge. It grants animal welfare officers the authority to intervene to prevent harm to animals and prohibits the ""mutilation"

They cautioned that while fishing was exempted, measures should be in place to prevent unnecessary suffering inflicted by those involved in the activity. The committee expressed concerns that the bill could weaken legal protections for animals, such as the law on abandonment, and urged the government to revise clauses related to prosecuting cruelty offenses.

According to MPs, there was an average of one prison suicide every four days between 1999 and 2003. The report, which resulted from a year-long investigation"
89,"The report highlighted that a significant number of individuals who later committed suicide had sought help for their issues before they committed any offenses. It raised concerns about whether prison was the best environment for them and suggested that earlier intervention could have prevented their incarceration. The report emphasized the need for more resources and a decrease in the reliance on imprisonment to address the issue in the future. Jean Corston, the committee chairman and Labour MP, stated that every death in custody is unacceptable, regardless of the circumstances."
90,"Throughout our investigation, we have consistently observed that individuals with severe vulnerabilities, including mental health issues, substance abuse problems, and suicidal tendencies, are being placed in custody. These highly vulnerable individuals are being housed in a system that is clearly inadequate to address even their most basic needs. While crime rates are decreasing, the number of people in custody is on the rise. The excessive reliance on prisons for some of the most vulnerable individuals in the country lies at the root of the challenges we have identified. Without a fundamental shift in our approach to incarcerating vulnerable individuals, we will continue to fall short of our obligations"

He added, ""The Liberal Democrats will seek the British people's backing this year as the party with the most effective policies to promote freedom and fairness and rebuild trust."""
129,"The government refutes claims that Gordon Brown is planning to remove Alan Milburn as Labour's election chief. Alan Johnson, the work and pensions minister, stated that it is inaccurate to imply that the chancellor will replace Mr. Milburn, emphasizing that they will collaborate as a team. A Sunday Business report suggested that Mr. Brown might oversee media strategy, with Mr. Milburn transitioning to a more discreet position. Labour has consistently asserted that Mr. Brown will play a key role in the campaign."
130,"Many Labour backbenchers are reportedly unhappy with the election campaign's progress and have expressed a desire for the chancellor to have a more prominent role. Some observers believe that the Tories have taken the lead, forcing Labour to react to Conservative policy announcements. Recent opinion polls indicate that the Tories are closing in on Labour. Party strategists are considering putting Mr. Brown in the spotlight after seeing a rise in support in private polling following his Budget presentation last week. However, a report in the Sunday Telegraph suggests that Mr. Milburn is reluctant to let the chancellor take on a more significant role if it means diminishing"
131,"Speaker Michael Martin has declared that Members of Parliament will be expelled from the Commons if they are caught using Blackberries in the chamber. These handheld devices, which cost £200, have multiple functions such as making phone calls, sending emails, and acting as pagers. The use of Blackberries came under scrutiny this week when Alastair Campbell mistakenly sent a profanity-filled message to a Newsnight journalist. Mr. Martin disclosed that some MPs had been using their Blackberries during discussions and also warned against the use of concealed earpieces."
132,"The practice of using electronic devices in the Commons chamber has always been disapproved of. If a mobile phone or pager makes a sound, it can lead to a stern reprimand from either the Speaker or their deputies. The Speaker presides over debates in the Commons and is responsible for maintaining order in the chamber and upholding the rules and traditions of the House. The Speaker is always an MP selected by fellow members, who, upon nomination, relinquishes all party affiliations."
133,"Critics have accused Labour of using anti-Semitic imagery in posters that allegedly portray Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin. The poster features Mr. Howard hypnotizing individuals with a pocket watch, accompanied by the slogan: ""I can spend the same money twice."" While the editor of the Jewish Chronicle expressed concern over the image, Labour maintains that it is simply anti-Tory. Following the backlash, Labour removed the image from its website, citing a more popular alternative among party members. The party plans to conduct focus groups to assess a new poster depicting Mr. Howard and shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin with a"
134,"The comparison between the hypnotism poster and the portrayal of the Dickens character Fagin in the stage version of the musical Oliver! has sparked controversy. Another poster choice offered to Labour members depicted Mr Howard and Mr Letwin, both Jewish, as flying pigs, leading to accusations of anti-Semitism. When asked about the poster, Mr Howard did not address the claims directly but instead referenced Tony Blair's past criticism of ""personalised abusive campaigning."" Jewish Chronicle editor Ned Temko noted that while there was a mixed reaction to the first poster, emails from readers expressed deeper concern about the hypnotism image. Tem"
135,"Labour members were presented with a series of ideas, including a controversial poster, to choose from for the upcoming election. Labour MP Louise Ellman criticized the hypnotism image as insensitive but cautioned against labeling it as anti-Semitic, emphasizing that it was a critique of Tory economic policies. Labour campaign spokesman Fraser Kemp defended the poster, explaining that it depicted Mr. Howard as a hypnotist and aimed to highlight the Tories' deceptive tactics. Despite concerns raised, he stressed that the overarching message of the posters was to expose the Tories' attempts to deceive the public. The decision to remove the image from the party's"
136,"MPs have stated that divorced parents trying to see their children face challenges within the legal system. The Constitutional Affairs Select Committee noted that parents with custody could take advantage of delays to prevent their ex-partners from gaining access. MPs recommended that courts should be a last option, but if used, their decisions should be enforced more strictly. However, they disagreed with the idea proposed by certain advocacy groups that there should be a legal assumption of equal access."
137,"At present, the prevailing belief is that the well-being of the child is of utmost importance. Members of Parliament argued that enforcing a standardized approach on all families, regardless of the child's specific needs, would diminish the priority given to individual children's welfare. They suggested amending the law to mandate family courts to consider the significance of preserving the relationship between the child and the non-resident parent in disputed cases. This adjustment would reaffirm the rights of non-resident parents to maintain contact with their children, as well as the children's rights to have contact with both parents, while still allowing for flexibility"
138,"Despite the courts' efforts to avoid conscious bias, there is significant evidence to suggest that non-resident parents are often at a disadvantage under the current system. In contested family cases where there is strong animosity between the parties, it is difficult to believe that tactical delay is not sometimes used to benefit resident parents. Committee chairman Alan Beith described the five-month inquiry as ""complex and emotive."" He emphasized the need for more cases to be resolved through professional mediation and negotiation rather than through the courts. Beith stressed that the court system should only be used as a last resort, particularly in cases where"

In an interview before a meeting in London to discuss Palestinian reforms, Mr. Abbas highlighted the Palestinian Authority's full commitment to putting an end to violence. The attack, which resulted in five casualties, marked the first of its kind since Mr. Abbas assumed office. He also mentioned that Israel had shared information with the PA to help track down the perpetrators. Despite Syria's denials, the Israeli government maintains that the country was involved in the nightclub bombing,"
140,"In an email interview with the British newspaper the Independent, Mr Abbas expressed his belief that peace is achievable at present and that they are prepared to engage in negotiations with Israel to achieve a genuine and enduring peace founded on justice and international legitimacy. He emphasized the importance of not letting the opportunity slip away and highlighted the responsibility of all parties involved. The meeting on Palestinian reform scheduled for Tuesday will be hosted by British Prime Minister Tony Blair and will be attended by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, World Bank officials, and foreign ministers from 23 European and Arab"
141,"Tony Blair reassured Labour backbenchers that the party's pursuit of a third term in power will not be hindered. Amid rumors of a rift with Gordon Brown, the prime minister addressed MPs, denying claims from a new book that he reneged on a promise to step down before the next general election. Chancellor Brown, focused on winning the election, is set to collaborate with election supremo Alan Milburn for a Labour poster launch. During a meeting with the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), Mr. Blair emphasized the importance of unity within the party to secure the much-needed third term."
142,"Labour MPs preparing for the upcoming election are increasingly worried about recent developments, with some expressing their discontent at a recent PLP meeting. Health Secretary John Reid cautioned against those who contribute to damaging speculation, emphasizing the importance of unity and the party's re-election prospects. Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown both dismissed allegations of broken promises and vowed to remain focused on the goal of securing a Labour government in the upcoming election."
143,"Mr Blair's spokesperson stated on Monday that the prime minister is committed to carrying out government duties as he believes it is what the people desire. Mr Brown confirmed that he talked about the election campaign with Mr Blair on Saturday and assured him of his involvement. According to Mr Peston, there is mutual hostility and disdain between the two. Mr Blair made the decision to step down in November 2003 due to a loss of trust from voters following the Iraq war."
144,"In June 2004, he changed his mind after receiving support from Cabinet allies and suspecting that the chancellor was plotting against him. Allegedly, Mr. Brown expressed disbelief in anything Mr. Blair told him. Conservative co-chairman Liam Fox compared the two men to ""self-absorbed schoolboys."" Liberal Democrat parliamentary chairman Matthew Taylor criticized their personal ambitions for hindering good governance. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock suggested that Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown could handle the media frenzy by affirming their commitment to not allowing a dispute to harm Labour or British interests. He emphasized on BBC"

Darlington Council officials are now working against the clock to address the issue before the deadline of 4 November, when all-postal votes from around two million electors are due. A spokesperson for Darlington Council explained that while they have dispatched the ballot papers, the issue lies with Royal Mail, who are looking into the matter to determine the cause of the problem."
146,"According to a Royal Mail spokesperson, an issue with the delivery route in the Mowden area of Darlington is currently under investigation. This has resulted in several hundred properties not receiving their ballot papers. The Royal Mail is collaborating with the council to resolve the problem and ensure that all affected individuals receive their ballot papers through special hand deliveries if necessary. There have been no reports of similar issues related to the regional assembly vote. The Darlington Council representative mentioned that initial complaints from a few Mowden residents led to a broader understanding of the situation.

147,"Ministers are instructing councils to identify additional locations for travellers, as disputes persist over a series of unauthorized encampments. Councils will also receive enhanced authority to evict illegal settlements established by Gypsy communities on rural properties. Housing minister Yvette Cooper announced that councils will receive additional funding to enhance official caravan parks. In November, MPs urged ministers to compel councils to establish sites due to the lack of stopping places for 3,500 travellers. Ms. Cooper stated that the annual scheme to upgrade existing traveller sites will now consider council proposals for new stopping areas. Over the past four years, the"
148,"Ms. Cooper highlighted two main issues in the current planning system regarding Gypsy and traveller sites. Firstly, local authorities are not identifying sufficient suitable locations for private or public sites. Secondly, they lack the necessary powers to promptly address development on unsuitable sites. This has led to an abundance of developments on inappropriate sites, causing tensions and challenges for both neighboring communities and the Gypsy and traveller populations. To address this, consultations are underway for new regulations that would require local authorities to pinpoint more suitable sites and grant them additional powers to take immediate action against developments in unsuitable locations that pose risks to local amenities"
149,"Tony Blair criticized the Conservative spending plans as unrealistic and warned that they could lead to economic failure. The Prime Minister emphasized at a Labour Party event that the Tory policies would jeopardize the country's economic stability. In contrast, Tory leader Michael Howard defended his party's proposal to cut £35bn in ""wasteful"" spending to enable £4bn in tax cuts. Additionally, Tory shadow home secretary David Davis stated that the cuts would be funded by eliminating inefficiencies that had grown under Labour's administration. Blair highlighted the difference between a reformed Labour party, positioned in the political center, and a"

""It's essentially a blueprint for the same cycle of economic booms and busts, along with cuts in public services that characterized the 18 years of Conservative rule."" Mr. Blair went on to say that the Conservatives have failed to learn from their past mistakes. In contrast, he highlighted how New Labour had evolved by listening to the people. Mr. Blair then proceeded to outline his government's accomplishments and urged the party to continue building on them. ""We now face a decision: defend our"

In a statement released in advance, he urged delegates to demonstrate unity and determination to make necessary long-term decisions. Mr. Brown cautioned that the Conservatives were planning the largest cuts ever seen in an election manifesto. In response, Tory shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin accused Mr. Blair of misrepresenting the party's plans and questioned how Labour would finance its"
152,"Tory leader Michael Howard has refuted suggestions that his immigration policy was encroaching on the territory of the British National Party (BNP). BNP leader Nick Griffin mentioned to the Independent that he anticipated some BNP supporters might switch to the Tories due to this issue. However, Mr Howard stated that he disagreed with the notion that the Tories and BNP appealed to the same voting instincts. When asked if he would welcome BNP voters, he responded to the BBC by saying, ""I do not want anyone to support these extremist parties."" He further explained on BBC Radio 4's Today programme"
153,"The Conservatives have pledged to set a maximum limit on the number of individuals permitted to enter the UK, using the slogan: ""Enforcing immigration limits is not discriminatory."" All political parties are intensifying their campaigning efforts ahead of the anticipated general election on 5 May. Labour has introduced its own ""points system"" to ensure that migrants seeking employment in the UK possess the necessary skills, while rejecting the idea of immigration quotas. The Liberal Democrats have cautioned both parties against catering to prejudice. Mr. Griffin expressed to the Independent that the Conservative Party's proposals represent a deliberate shift towards the British National Party's territory"
154,"The Liberal Democrats are offering pensioners the opportunity to save on energy costs during the ongoing snowy and cold weather. The party's proposal aims to help the average pensioner save £100 annually and reduce winter-related deaths. Currently, the government provides £200 for winter fuel to households with individuals over 60, and £300 for those over 80. The Conservative party has pledged to maintain these payments. The Liberal Democrats suggest allowing pensioners to exchange these winter fuel payments for discounts on home insulation. According to Shadow local government secretary Ed Davey, this new approach will significantly reduce the number of elderly individuals"

According to research from University College London, lowering the alcohol limit from 80mg to 50mg per 100ml of blood could prevent 65 fatalities annually. The findings will be presented by the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety as MPs prepare to vote on the Road Safety Bill, which focuses on speeding fines rather than changing the drink-drive limit. Professor Richard Allsop, a transportation expert, conducted the study and predicts that the lower limit would also result in 230 fewer serious injuries on UK"
156,"According to a 1998 Department of Transport report, reducing the legal blood alcohol limit from 80mg to 50mg could potentially save 65 lives annually. The assumption is that drivers who currently stay under the limit would continue to do so, and those who slightly exceed the limit would also reduce their drinking. Professor Allsop stated that this change could prevent about half of the deaths in accidents where the driver's blood alcohol content is within 30mg of the current limit. Only a small percentage of drivers, particularly during weekend evenings, would need to adjust their drinking habits to achieve this."
157,"Parliamentarians should carefully consider this issue. According to Liberal Democrat transport spokesman John Thurso, Britons are more effective at self-policing through consensus rather than relying solely on enforcement measures. Thurso highlighted the ongoing issue of drink-driving as a significant cause of accidents, with statistics indicating a concerning increase in incidents involving intoxicated drivers. He pointed out a 29% decrease in breathalyzing drivers since 1997, urging the government to take action to address this issue. The upcoming Road Safety Bill, set for its second reading, proposes allowing roadside breath test results to be used in court,"

The Conservative leader highlighted that English local authorities have spent over £3 billion, equivalent to £140 per household, on asylum since Labour came into power in 1997. Mr. Howard is set to address activists in Kent, expressing concerns that voters' goodwill and willingness to assist others are being taken advantage of. Opposition parties and refugee organizations have already criticized the Conservative Party's proposals for implementing annual limits on asylum seekers."

He called for a gradual removal of British troops when conditions permit, emphasizing the importance of any exit strategy in reinforcing the democratic process."

She suggested that this organization should be responsible for monitoring and releasing immigration statistics, operating independently from the government. Roche argued that such a body would provide a counterbalance to groups like Migration Watch, which she criticized for masquerading as independent while holding anti-immigration views. In response, Migration Watch clarified that it does not oppose all immigration and highlighted the government's existing publication of accurate data. Sir Andrew Green, the chairman of Migration Watch, dismissed the need for an independent body,"
170,"He stated that in the next 20 years, one out of every three households will be a result of immigration. He emphasized that the country is already more crowded than India and four times more crowded than France. Labour MP for Hornsey and Wood Green, Ms Roche, supports legal migration and believes it should be embraced. She expressed her desire for a body to analyze and publish migration figures independently from the government, in order to address fears that are often exaggerated during immigration debates."
171,"Long-time Labour MP and former Cabinet minister Jack Cunningham has announced his intention to retire at the upcoming election. Serving as one of the few ministers from the Blair era who also worked under Jim Callaghan, he was appointed to oversee agriculture when Labour came back into power in 1997. Throughout his career, Mr. Cunningham became known as Tony Blair's trusted ""cabinet enforcer"" and has been the representative for the Copeland constituency since 1970. Tony Blair praised him as a significant figure within the Labour party and a close personal friend."
172,"While Labour was in opposition for an extended period, Mr. Cunningham took on various shadow roles such as foreign affairs, the environment, and trade. As agriculture minister, he sparked controversy by implementing a ban on beef on the bone due to concerns about BSE. He resigned from the government in 1999 and has since chaired the all-party committee on Lords reform. He has remained a steadfast supporter of the government while serving as a backbencher in recent years."
173,"Tony Blair emphasized the significance of the agreement that moves Turkey closer to EU membership, stating that it is crucial for global peace and security. The deal, reached at the European Council meeting last week, also disproved any notions of conflict between Muslims and Christians, according to Mr. Blair. He described it as a milestone in achieving a long-standing British goal. Conservative leader Michael Howard noted that the agreement dispelled any notion that the EU was biased against Islam."
174,"Mr Howard stated that Turkey's involvement with the EU would serve as a valuable link between Europe and the rest of the world. However, he contended that the EU constitution was not designed to accommodate a country as large as Turkey. Despite the controversy surrounding the idea, Mr Blair has been a prominent supporter of Turkish membership, emphasizing the significant progress made by the Turkish leadership in enhancing human rights records. The decision to initiate formal talks with Ankara was made despite the EU's requirement for Turkey to acknowledge Cyprus, with the understanding that this issue could be addressed at a later time.

Despite agreeing to important modifications, MPs approved the Prevention of Terrorism Bill, although Labour's majority was reduced to 14. The Bill is now encountering resistance from peers who are opposed to the house arrest measures. Lord Strathclyde, the Conservative leader in the House of Lords, warned that ministers should anticipate significant revisions to the Bill."
179,"The Bill includes provisions for ""control orders"" that could involve measures such as house arrest, curfews, tagging, or restrictions on telephone and internet usage for foreign terror suspects. These control orders would replace the current ability to detain such suspects without trial, a practice that has been deemed unlawful by the law lords. On Monday, Members of Parliament voted 272-219 in support of the Bill following concessions made by Mr. Clarke. The government's majority was reduced from 161 to just 14 as a cross-party amendment was narrowly defeated in the Commons, despite the backing of 62 Labour rebels"
180,"During an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr. Clarke expressed confidence that the changes he had made to the Bill to address concerns in the Commons would be sufficient to gain approval from his colleagues in the Lords. He stated, ""I believe that the adjustments I announced yesterday will be enough to secure the House of Lords' agreement. I am not inclined to offer any further concessions on the Bill."" The proposed amendment by Mr. Clarke will be discussed by the Lords on Tuesday without prior consideration by MPs, and a vote is unlikely to take place during the debate.

Despite claiming ignorance of the poll date, it is widely anticipated to be on 5 May. During a notably personal address in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair emphasized his enduring passion and determination since his initial days in office at 10 Downing Street. He characterized his relationship with the public as initially euphoric, followed by struggles to meet expectations, and eventually leading to heated arguments and disagreements. He cautioned his supporters against complacency"

Dr Fox criticized Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers for spreading falsehoods about their opponents' policies and then attacking those falsehoods. He described Labour's tactics as fear and smear.

Tony Blair expressed hope on Wednesday that the former home secretary would return to government in the future. Blunkett stepped down in December following an investigation into his involvement in his ex-lover's nanny's visa application. While Blair stated that Blunkett left without any blemish on his character, Tory Dominic Grieve criticized the operations of Blunkett's office as ""scandalous."" Blair, speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, emphasized his belief in Blunkett's integrity"

However, shadow attorney general Mr. Grieve stated that the possibility of Mr. Blunkett returning as a minister should not be dismissed. Senior Labour backbencher Martin O'Neill, who heads the Commons trade committee, believed that the prime minister would want one of his trusted advisors back by his side.

The Liberal Democrats expressed disbelief that he and his colleagues could not recall how Leoncia Casalme's application for indefinite leave to remain moved from Mr. Blunkett's office to the head of the Immigration and Nationality Department. In contrast, the Conservatives accused officials of a ""collective memory lapse."" However, Sir"

However, opposition parties raised concerns about potential steep rises due to council tax rebanding. Additionally, £13.4m will be provided through the business support grant scheme. Despite the challenges, Essex expressed confidence that councils could maintain reasonable tax levels with a 5% spending increase"
192,"The funding package includes an increase in the grant to assist councils serving the most deprived communities and a 16.4% boost in capital expenditure support. Ms Essex expressed satisfaction, stating that the agreement benefits local government by enabling well-managed Welsh councils to enhance their services and maintain reasonable council tax rates. She emphasized that it is now the responsibility of council leaders to effectively manage their budgets at a local level.

The initiative also includes establishing a dedicated policing team for each neighborhood and implementing a 10-point mandatory customer charter. The home secretary emphasized the importance of setting targets to ensure that the public receives a prompt and effective response from law enforcement.

He emphasized that police services performing well would receive additional funding and increased autonomy. However, he made it clear that he would not hesitate to intervene in cases where the public was not being adequately served. The home secretary is currently reassessing his authority to suspend or dismiss chief constables following a dispute with Humberside chief David Westwood regarding intelligence failures related to the Soham murderer Ian Huntley. Opposition parties are advocating for more localized policing to address issues such as nuisance behavior and crime"
195,"Mr. Davis expressed concerns that the police forces were already overwhelmed by existing government initiatives and the latest plans did little to reassure them. Mark Oaten, the former Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, agreed that increasing links between local people and the police was important, but emphasized that reducing paperwork and investing in modern equipment were essential for the success of these measures. Before addressing MPs, Mr. Blunkett and Tony Blair visited Welling School in south east London, a community policing initiative. Mr. Blunkett emphasized the importance of community involvement in policing, harking back to a time when the police and"

The new proposals would grant all police forces the authority to detain suspects. An additional £50 million was pledged on Tuesday to expedite the recruitment of 2,000 new CSOs. Within two years, each force will be required to adhere to a ""coppers' contract"" outlining the expected level of service for the public. A recent Mori poll indicated that satisfaction with policing decreases with increased interaction, unlike health and education services. The plans also involve allowing"
197,"Ministers are considering the possibility of electronically tagging parents who refuse to allow their former partners contact with their children. Lord Falconer, the constitutional affairs secretary, mentioned that curfews and community service orders could also be used if court orders for parental access were ignored. He emphasized that the changes were not driven by fathers' activists but rather by a recognition that there is a problem. Each year, around 15,000 to 20,000 couples end up in court to settle access disputes, even though in the majority of separations, court intervention is not necessary."
198,"During an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lord Falconer expressed his belief that voluntary mediation could be a valuable tool in resolving disputes prior to them escalating to court. However, he cautioned against mandatory mediation, as he believed it could result in individuals participating with a negative mindset. Additionally, proposed initiatives include the implementation of parenting plans to offer guidance on access arrangements, drawing from successful real-life examples."
199,"Increasing the use of in-court conciliation, conducting additional informal hearings prior to contested court cases, and enhancing access to legal, emotional, and practical advice through telephone and internet services."
200,"Legal aid reforms have been implemented to encourage early resolution of disputes. While judges have the authority to imprison parents who violate contact orders, this extreme measure is seldom employed due to concerns about its impact on the child's well-being. The objective of the updated laws is to introduce a variety of penalties, including fines, community service, anger management or parenting classes, and curfews, as alternatives to incarceration."
201,"Failure to adhere to these measures may lead to offenders being electronically monitored. Lord Falconer suggested the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, stating, ""While tagging might be considered extreme, it is worth discussing."" A spokesperson mentioned that the full details of the new powers will not be disclosed until a bill is released ""within the next two weeks.""

Andrew Marr commented on the situation, emphasizing the damaging nature of the relationship between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Marr also mentioned that many ministers believed Blair might try to remove Brown from the Treasury post after the election, depending on the"

Recent speculation about a rift between Mr. Blair and Mr. Brown arose following their differing reactions to the Asian tsunami.

In a written statement, Constitutional Affairs Minister Christopher Leslie announced that the minimum age requirement for an MP, currently set at 21, would be lowered to 18. This proposal comes after a suggestion made by the Electoral Commission last year. Mr. Leslie, who became an MP at the age of 24 in 1997, stated that the government aims to pass legislation to implement this change, but it may not be in effect before the upcoming general election, expected to take place in May."

The Votes at 16 alliance supports the idea of engaging people by lowering the candidacy age but believes that lowering the voting age would have a greater impact. Spokesman Alex Folkes emphasized that while candidacy only affects politicians, the voting age impacts millions of younger individuals. The alliance hopes that the government will introduce a bill broad enough to allow amendments to test support for reducing the voting age.

He argued that EU cooperation could improve UK immigration controls."

Gerrard had expressed doubt to the BBC about their chances of winning the trophy this year, prompting Benitez to urge him to have a more positive mindset. Benitez emphasized the importance of having a winning mentality within the team and encouraged everyone to believe in their ability to win the Champions League. He stressed the need for a mindset focused on victory, stating that he always aims to win."
569,"Benitez emphasized the importance of focusing on solutions after a loss, rather than solely fixating on winning the next game. He highlighted the unpredictability of draws and suggested that a victory in the upcoming match could potentially lead to facing a weaker opponent due to various factors like injuries or suspensions. Benitez is eager to secure his first trophy with Liverpool since joining from Valencia, with the Carling Cup final against Chelsea in Cardiff on Sunday presenting a significant opportunity."

She expressed frustration at the criticism, stating, ""It's unfair - I'm tired of staying silent."" Serena highlighted their dedication to training and the challenges they have faced, including serious injuries and surgeries.

The defence team's attempt to have the case dismissed at a pre-trial hearing in San Francisco was rejected by US district court judge Susan Ilston. She scheduled the case involving four men accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs to elite athletes to be heard in March. A final decision on whether the trial will proceed is expected in January.

576,"One newspaper declared last Saturday that England remained the top team in the world. However, events at Twickenham later that afternoon made that statement seem a bit silly. This highlighted the exciting unpredictability of Test rugby at the highest level, concluding a thrilling autumn series. The final weekend created confusion in the global rankings, as Australia's victory in London was followed by France's defeat to New Zealand. Wallabies coach Eddie Jones stated upon returning to Sydney, ""It's clear that there is currently no definitive number one team in the world. There are about four, five, or maybe even six teams all"
577,"With rugby looking promising overall, the upcoming Six Nations Championship is anticipated to be the most competitive in ten years. While teams like the Wallabies, All Blacks, and Springboks are taking a break before focusing on Super 12 matters, Europe's top teams have less than 10 weeks to prepare for international competition. This year, the Six Nations title race is not just between England and France, thanks to Ireland's improvement and the potential for Wales to secure a significant victory following their strong performances in the autumn."
578,"After achieving their first Triple Crown in 19 years last season, Ireland is aiming to secure their first Five/Six Nations title since 1985. They will kick off their campaign with away matches against Italy and Scotland, followed by hosting England and France at Lansdowne Road. The team's confidence is high following their significant win against the Springboks, and Ronan O'Gara's clutch drop goal against Argentina demonstrated their ability to win close matches. However, England and France, who have dominated the Six Nations in recent years, are not likely to give up easily."
579,"The Springboks' restructuring indicated that despite the departure of key players like Martin Johnson and Lawrence Dallaglio, they have the talent to succeed. The close loss to Australia served as a wake-up call that not everything is perfect for the team, but new coach Andy Robinson has started the process of rebuilding after the World Cup. There is a renewed determination to reach previous levels of success, and if England can win their first Six Nations match in Cardiff, they could potentially secure their fourth title in six years."
580,"We are once again in a familiar revival zone, but this time it seems that there is actual substance to support the revived style. Despite South Africa's over-confidence resulting in a closer score in Cardiff than anticipated, Wales could argue that they were close to victory against the All Blacks in one of the most memorable Tests in recent history. If Mike Ruddock can establish a dependable set-piece foundation with his team, there is no reason why they should not achieve victories in February. The events of the past two weeks have..."
581,"Following a successful start to the autumn series with a remarkable win against Australia, the team found themselves confused after suffering a surprising defeat to Argentina, their first loss since the World Cup. This loss, typically associated with French inconsistency, was overshadowed by a crushing 45-6 defeat by New Zealand in Paris. Coach Bernard Laporte expressed concern about the lack of emerging young talent to replace the experienced players. Despite this, the French team will have the opportunity to showcase their skills in the opening match of the Six Nations."
582,"In Paris, the Scots' recent performances against Australia were promising, but their defeat by the Springboks led coach Matt Williams to reconsider his belief that a victory against a major nation was near. Despite players like Chris Cusiter and Ali Hogg improving their reputations, the team's lack of top-class players continues to hinder their progress. The team, who will face Ireland and Wales at home before playing in Scotland, are optimistic about achieving more than one win in the Championship for the first time.

While winning the New York marathon cannot erase the disappointment of Athens, it does provide hope and encouragement for the future. Had Paula's final race of the year been in Athens, it would have been hard to remain optimistic. Now, she can close the chapter on this year and start planning for what lies ahead. Even if she had not won the race, there were many positives to take away from it. Paula has proven that she can push herself when"
602,"I had a conversation with Paula before the race, and she expressed feeling trapped in a lose-lose situation. She believed that if she won, people would question why she couldn't perform as well in Athens. On the other hand, if she lost, they would say her career was finished. Many were curious about what would happen if Paula had to withdraw from the race, as she did in Athens. However, that scenario was never a possibility. Even if she didn't win, she would have continued running. The issues that led to her withdrawal in Athens, such as minor injuries, fatigue,"
603,"Throughout his illustrious international career, controversy has always been closely linked to Lawrence Dallaglio. The sudden end of his nine-year career, just four days before the season began, was unexpected. However, Dallaglio has consistently marched to the beat of his own drum. From the moment he burst onto the international stage, Dallaglio has divided opinions. To England supporters, he was a hero who could do no wrong. A key figure in England's successful period, Dallaglio's greatest achievement was his contribution to the team that secured the Rugby World Cup in 200"
604,"On the other hand, rival fans have often viewed Dallaglio as embodying the less favorable traits of English rugby. Unafraid to express his opinions, whether directed at the referee or the opposing team on the field, or towards his coach or the media off the field, Dallaglio has occasionally clashed with others. Dallaglio joined the England team that surprisingly won the first Rugby Sevens World Cup in 1993. It took him two more years to move up to the full England XV, but once there, he excelled.

Things took a turn for the worse when a newspaper sting led to him losing his England captaincy due to allegations of drug use, which he was later cleared of. Devastated, Dallaglio resigned as captain but later made a comeback at club level before returning to the England team as a deputy to new captain Johnson. Despite missed opportunities for Grand Slams, Dallaglio played a crucial role in the new-look England team's journey"
606,"Rumors started circulating that his career was finished, but in typical Dallaglio fashion, he committed to a rigorous rehabilitation program to come back as an even more formidable physical presence. Although the injury took away much of his speed, Dallaglio adapted and excelled as a top-notch close-quarters number eight. He was the only player to play every minute of England's World Cup victory in Australia, playing a crucial role in securing the historic win and earning the admiration of England supporters. After Johnson retired, Dallaglio's career came full circle when Woodward appointed him as England captain"
607,"England's current challenge is finding a suitable replacement for a player who is considered nearly impossible to replace. While names like Matt Dawson, Jonny Wilkinson, Phil Vickery, and Hill have been suggested as potential captains to fill Dallaglio's role, the real difficulty lies in finding a player who can match the 32-year-old's skills on the field. Despite capable players like Joe Worsley and Chris Jones, the absence of a clear standout candidate highlights the significant impact Dallaglio has had on English rugby."

702,"He became the first man in 80 years to win both the 1500m and 5,000m titles. After he secured the 5,000m crown, I finished commentating and immediately rushed down the stairs to give him a big hug, pushing past everyone in my way. He is among the few African runners who have embraced the mile tradition and enjoys listening to Roger Bannister stories. Spending time with Hicham is something I appreciate, despite our limited language skills. Paula's experience in Athens this year was a personal low point and also fell short of the nation's"

Any slight discomfort during marathon preparation can have a significant impact later on during the race. Paula's experience at the Olympics was a valuable learning opportunity for her and many others, myself included. Her victory in the New York Marathon was incredibly exciting, with a close competition against Susan Chepkemei of Kenya, which is not common in marathon races. It was a thrilling moment for athletics fans"
704,"Kelly and the boys' 4x100m victories highlighted the shortcomings in the overall performance of the British team. There is a worrying lack of individuals capable of reaching senior level finals. The sole male track finalist was Michael East in the 1500m. I am starting to question where the new talent is. The outlook for British athletics appears bleak as no medals were won at the world junior championships in Italy. Dani Barnes finished fourth in the 1500m, the highest placing for Team GB. Without athletes reaching junior finals, the prospects for the Beijing Olympics and beyond seem grim."
705,"This year, one of my favorite moments was Benita Johnson's victory at the world cross country championships in March. With Paula absent, we often associate the event with African runners, so it was truly remarkable to see an Australian athlete claim the title. I must admit, I'm growing tired of the ongoing drug scandals, particularly the Balco case. I hope that everything will be resolved soon so that we can focus on other things."
706,"That being said, I am always glad when individuals who cheat with drugs are apprehended as it demonstrates that the sport is taking a stand against it and no longer turning a blind eye. One positive outcome of the Balco scandal is that more people are now speaking out. It is crucial for more individuals to step forward and assist the authorities in eliminating cheaters. Concerning the case of Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou, suspicions have been lingering over Kenteris for some time. Ultimately, we cannot allow drugs to continue harming the sport, as it h"

With all eyes on her once again, she aims to overcome the setbacks she faced at the Athens Olympics, where she did not complete the marathon and the 10,000m race. BBC Sport delves into the obstacles Radcliffe must overcome as she prepares for the upcoming race."
725,"The key to completing a challenging 26.2-mile race largely depends on an athlete's belief in their ability to do so. Every runner will face obstacles and doubts, symbolized by the wall that asks, ""Are you strong enough to finish?"" This question may weigh heavily on Radcliffe following her recent struggles in high-profile races. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards advises the 30-year-old to rely on her past successes to overcome any crisis of confidence. Richards suggests that Radcliffe should not deviate from her proven training and racing strategies, but instead focus on rebuilding her confidence through successful performances."

However, if she fails to win, she risks being labeled as a has-been and her reputation may suffer. This could have negative effects on her sponsorship deals, appearance fees, and self-esteem.

""You can't alter the past,"" Richards cautioned. ""While only one person can win the marathon, many can be successful."" Paula must determine what accomplishments will leave her feeling fulfilled at the race's conclusion. The route from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the most challenging in the world."

Richards notes that the conditions in New York will be more favorable for Radcliffe compared to Athens, where heat stress was a significant challenge.

We do not want a repeat of Michael Owen's departure for a minimal fee. Realistically, a transfer fee of £50m would provide Rafa with the resources needed to revamp the squad. If we can manage to achieve this while retaining Gerrard, it would greatly benefit the team. Nevertheless, I would be satisfied with Gerrard's transfer for any amount exceeding £35m."

Despite France not hitting their stride yet, Dominici believes they can still succeed through hard work, especially if scrum-half Dimitri Yachvili maintains his strong goalkicking form. Dominici expressed confidence in the team's ability to achieve something significant with an efficient kicker, solid defense, and players who give their all. He emphasized that the true winners of the competition will become clearer after the third matches. France coach Bernard Laporte will reveal the starting line-up next Tuesday for"
994,"Wales achieved their first away victory in the RBS Six Nations in almost four years by defeating Italy with six tries in Rome. Jonathan Thomas, Tom Shanklin, and Martyn Williams scored in the first half to give Wales a 19-5 lead at halftime. Italy's Luciano Orquera managed to score one try, but second-half tries from Brent Cockbain, Shane Williams, and Robert Sidoli secured the win for Wales. Fly-half Stephen Jones converted four tries as Wales continued their impressive start to the tournament. Coming off a win against England, Wales started confidently and scored the"
995,"Stephen Jones, who continued to handle the kicking duties despite Gavin Henson's impressive performance against England, successfully converted a difficult kick from a wide angle. Wales had two opportunities to score again but were unable to make the crucial pass, allowing Italy to unexpectedly score in the 11th minute. Henson, wearing gold boots instead of the silver ones he wore against England, effortlessly evaded two defenders on the left side of the field. However, his attempted kick was blocked by Orquera, who seized the loose ball and sprinted to score in the right corner. Despite Wales struggling with their line"
996,"Wales extended their lead with a second try in the 21st minute, as Henson launched a high kick to the left corner where Shanklin outjumped Nitoglia to score his 15th Test try. Jones missed the conversion, and De Marigny's penalty attempt for Italy hit the upright. Henson's long-range goal attempt fell just short, but Wales managed to score a crucial third try before halftime. Luscombe broke away and passed to Martyn Williams, who cleverly grounded the ball against the post, with Jones converting the try. Italy, who had lost"
997,"Jones extended Wales' lead to 33-8 with successful conversions, allowing them to bring on five more substitutes for the final quarter. The sixth try, scored by Sidoli in the left corner, was the cherry on top after excellent teamwork from Williams and Sweeney. The only setback for Wales was Luscombe's hamstring injury.

1001,"Paula Radcliffe is advocating for athletes who are caught using drugs to be treated as criminals. The world record holder in the marathon believes that more action is necessary to eliminate the doubts and rumors that arise whenever a fast time is achieved in athletics. ""Using performance-enhancing drugs in sports should be considered a criminal act,"" stated the 30-year-old in an interview with the Sunday Times. ""It not only deceives fellow athletes but also deceives event organizers, sponsors, and the public."""
1002,"Radcliffe's remarks coincide with a period when numerous American sports figures are being scrutinized for potential steroid usage. She emphasized the need for consequences for athletes caught with performance-enhancing drugs, expressing concern that the current testing system fails to identify many of the substances being misused. This lack of detection means athletes may unknowingly compete at a disadvantage, unsure if their efforts are being overshadowed by those taking shortcuts through science. Radcliffe also highlighted the unfortunate reality that successful athletes often face suspicion and gossip instead of admiration, drawing from her own experiences to illustrate the emotional toll of such baseless accusations."

In contrast, Wales have showcased impressive rugby and are off to their best start since their last title win in 1994. Additionally, Wales have a strong track record at the Stade de France, winning their first two games there in 1999 and 2001. Making two changes from their previous match against Italy, Kevin Morgan replaces the injured Hal Luscombe on the right wing, while Ryan Jones joins the pack on the blind-side flank in place of Jonathan Thomas"

1010,"In Irish rugby, there used to be a standout subliminal moment each year, but now there are several memorable moments to reflect on with a mix of satisfaction and sadness. The past year has been remarkable for Irish rugby, with success not only for Eddie O'Sullivan's Triple Crown-winning team but also throughout the ranks, as they have been causing upsets against more established teams. O'Sullivan and his team achieved their first Triple Crown in 29 years and ended their autumn campaign with a perfect record. Despite finishing as runners-up in the RBS Six Nations for the second year in a row"
1011,"It is undeniable that Ireland's representation will be the largest ever, with a proposed 44-man squad. Brian O'Driscoll and Paul O'Connell are currently the top contenders for the captaincy. Gordon D'Arcy, who began his career as a teenager in 1999, received recognition when he was named the Six Nations Player of the Tournament. Not only did the senior squad bring honor to Ireland, but the young players also impressed on the big stage. The under-21 squad surprised skeptics by reaching the World Cup final in Scotland, where they were defeated by a strong"
1012,"Tune in to the complete interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website starting at 1900 GMT. Parry, in an exclusive conversation with BBC Sport, acknowledges that Gerrard, who has been linked with Chelsea, will ultimately decide his own future. Speaking on BBC Five Live, Parry stated, ""Steven prioritizes loyalty over money. He is the future of Liverpool."" Regardless of the amount, whether it's £30m, £40m, or £50m, we will reject offers. However, we understand that we cannot force Steven to stay if he wishes to leave"
1013,"In response to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool player Alan Hansen, he confirmed that discussions regarding new investment are still in progress. He also mentioned that shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan is still a potential option. Parry took on the role of chief executive at Liverpool in July 1998 after holding a similar position at the Premier League. Throughout his tenure at Anfield, there have been both successes and challenges. He had a busy summer overseeing the appointment of new manager Rafael Benitez and successfully retaining Steven Gerrard. When discussing Liverpool's captain and key player, Parry disclosed that Real"
1014,"During negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes, they inquired about the availability of the England midfield man. The response was clear - Steven is not available for sale. When questioned about Gerrard's future at Liverpool, Parry expressed his hope that he would remain with the team. He emphasized that they are working to build a team around Gerrard, as they share his ambition for success."
1015,"Steven's desire to win with Liverpool is greater than any other ambition he may have. Progress is a shared goal among the players for the upcoming season. Despite rumors of a potential bid from Chelsea, Liverpool's chief executive, Parry, has made it clear that Steven is not for sale. While the club wants him to stay, they respect his decision. Parry is also considering sponsorship deals for Liverpool's new stadium, inspired by Arsenal's lucrative agreement with Emirates."
1016,"In the past, deals have been done at very low prices, which made them not even worth considering. However, the Arsenal deal is so impressive that it makes you stop and think, ""wow, that's interesting."" Personally, I would prefer it over a shared stadium. While some Liverpool fans might see it as controversial, Parry argues that the potential financial benefits for the team should not be overlooked. The stadium will likely always be Anfield due to its historical significance, but exploring sponsorship opportunities would be a wise move. Regarding new investment, Liverpool is still in talks with an undisclosed investor, rumored"
1017,"If we don't have any investments, I would accept £50 million, but if we do, then we should keep him. Regarding the stadium, if it brings in money, does it really matter? £50 million for Gerrard? It doesn't matter who you are, the Directors would accept the offer, and that's how it should be. We can't afford to pass up that amount of money, even considering Gerrard's talent."
1018,"By crafting a shrewdly phrased message, the club has skillfully prompted Gerrard to take responsibility for his decision in a public manner, a move I believe is appropriate. The situation concerning Gerrard is crucial for Liverpool at this moment. It is our preference to secure his commitment to the club for an extended period. I am optimistic that he will not depart the club for a minimal fee, similar to how Michael Owen did."
1019,"Realistically, a budget of £50 million would enable Rafa to fully overhaul the squad. Yet, if we manage to both rebuild the team and retain Gerrard, it would be beneficial for us. Personally, I would be satisfied with Gerrard's sale for any amount exceeding £35 million. Parry's remarks are shrewd as they ensure that any potential Gerrard transfer in the future cannot be seen as a lack of ambition by the club to retain their top players. Increasing the stakes is another astute decision by Parry."
1020,"I believe we should retain Gerrard due to his strong loyalty and drive to succeed, which cannot be replaced by money. The crucial factor is Gerrard's happiness; if he expresses discontent, it would be unwise not to consider selling him. The concern lies in identifying potential replacements, especially considering the uncertainty of Champions League qualification."
1021,"Ireland's fly-half Ronan O'Gara described the team's 19-13 victory over England as a ""special"" triumph. O'Gara, who plays for Munster, scored 14 points, including two drop goals, to help maintain their Grand Slam aspirations. Speaking to BBC Sport, he acknowledged the challenging nature of the match but emphasized the significance of defeating England. Despite missing three opportunities to secure the win, O'Gara recognized the need for improvement moving forward. Hooker Shane Byrne echoed O'Gara's sentiments, noting the tough contest and praising the team"
1022,"Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan expressed surprise at England coach Andy Robinson's assertion that Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before halftime. O'Sullivan mentioned that he couldn't see from his vantage point, so he was unsure how Robinson could have been so certain. Despite the controversy, O'Sullivan acknowledged England's strong performance and credited them for making it a challenging match. He highlighted the importance of the team's defensive efforts and praised the well-executed try scored by Ireland. O'Sullivan disagreed with Robinson's claim that England dominated the forward play, pointing out the"

Despite acknowledging the Lions' formidable lineup, Umaga expressed confidence in New Zealand's ability to win the three-Test series. Speaking to BBC Sport while in England for the IRB Rugby Aid match, Umaga stated, ""They are an impressive team, potentially the most formidable I have faced. However, I believe in our team's capability to emerge victorious when they visit."" Lions head coach Sir Clive Woodward is expected to reveal the squad"
1039,"When Woodward was appointed last year, there was a widespread belief that he would heavily rely on his former England players. However, Umaga expressed doubt about this strategy given the competitive nature of the Six Nations. He acknowledged England's talented players and the likelihood of some making the Lions Test XV, but emphasized the strong performances of Wales and Ireland. Umaga anticipated an exciting match-up against Brian O'Driscoll in the upcoming Rugby Aid game at Twickenham, where O'Driscoll would lead the Northern Hemisphere team coached by Woodward. Umaga recognized the potential Lions call-ups for many players"

1047,"Leicester is taking a cautious approach regarding a potential bid for Andy Farrell if he decides to switch from rugby league to rugby union. Tigers boss John Wells emphasized that they are still in the early stages of the process and there are many uncertainties surrounding Farrell, particularly his medical condition. Wells highlighted that whoever signs Farrell will be taking a significant risk. Farrell recently underwent knee surgery and is projected to be sidelined for another three months. Leicester and Saracens are reportedly the frontrunners among rugby union clubs vying for Farrell's signature in case he transitions to the 15-man game."
1048,"Wells believes that if he switches to union, it would be best for him to start off playing in the backs. ""I think he could transition from league to union by starting in the center,"" Wells stated. ""England would likely want him to eventually move to the back row, where they can utilize his rugby league skills in the forwards. Whether he can successfully make that transition remains uncertain. The club will need to weigh the cost of taking that risk against the possibility of finding a replacement player."""

Coach Andy Robinson stated, ""The likelihood of him playing is very low as the infection is more serious than initially believed."""
1050,"Moody needed to receive intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection in his finger, which he injured while playing against France at Twickenham. The infection worsened during a brief appearance as a substitute for Leicester against Newcastle. ""The mud caused the issue,"" Robinson explained.

He expressed his frustration with Kaplan's decisions that led to two disallowed England ""tries"" and suggested that only one team was being refereed."

While skipping friendlies may please club managers by reducing the risk of player injuries, international coaches argue that playing is essential for team improvement. The debate continues, with no clear solution in sight. Scotland's new manager, Walter Smith, has opted for a training camp instead of a friendly to build team spirit before World Cup qualifiers, a wise move considering recent player struggles. John Toshack, in his first game as Wales manager, will focus on performance over results, but public expectations are high. Friendlies"

1121,"Tune in to the complete interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website starting at 1900 GMT. Parry, in an exclusive conversation with BBC Sport, acknowledges that Gerrard, who has been frequently linked with Chelsea, will ultimately make the decision about his future. Speaking on BBC Five Live, Parry stated, ""Steven values more than just money. He is crucial to Liverpool's future."" Regardless of the amount, whether it's ÃÂ£30m, ÃÂ£40m, or ÃÂ£50m, we will not entertain offers"
1122,"In response to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool player Alan Hansen, he confirmed that discussions regarding new investment are still in progress. He also mentioned that shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan is still being considered. Parry took on the role of chief executive at Liverpool in July 1998 after holding a similar position at the Premier League. Throughout his tenure at Anfield, there have been both successes and challenges. He had a hectic summer overseeing the appointment of new manager Rafael Benitez and successfully retaining Steven Gerrard. When discussing Liverpool's captain and key player, Parry disclosed that Real Madrid"
1123,"During negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes, they inquired about the England midfield man's availability. The response to Real Madrid was consistent - Steven is not available for purchase. When questioned about Gerrard's future at Liverpool for the upcoming season, Parry expressed his hope that he would remain with the team. He emphasized that they are working to construct a team centered around Gerrard, as they share his desire for success and understand his ambition."
1124,"""I believe Steven's greatest desire is to achieve success with Liverpool more than anything else. We are all eager to witness progress by the next season, and he is not the only one with that goal. Many other players share the same ambition, so we all have a collective objective in mind. It is anticipated that Chelsea will make a bid of over £30 million in the summer, but Parry has stated that he will not entertain any offers. There have been rumors circulating about Steven, most of which are unfounded. It was rumored that we had a deal in place last summer, but that was"
1125,"In the past, deals were often done at very low prices, making them not even worth considering. However, the Arsenal deal is so impressive that it makes you stop and think, 'wow, that's interesting.' Personally, I would prefer it over a shared stadium. While some Liverpool fans may disagree, Peter Parry argues that the potential financial benefits could greatly benefit the team. The stadium will likely remain Anfield due to its historical significance, but exploring sponsorship opportunities would be wise. Regarding new investment, Liverpool is still in talks with an undisclosed investor, rumored to be from the Middle East. This"
1126,"If we don't have any investments, I would accept £50 million, but if we do, then we should keep him. Regarding the stadium, if it brings in money, why does it matter? £50 million for Gerrard? It doesn't matter who you are, the Directors would accept the offer, and that's the right decision. We can't afford to pass up that amount of money, even considering Gerrard's talent."
1127,"By crafting a shrewdly phrased statement, the club has successfully prompted Gerrard to publicly determine his own fate, a move I believe is appropriate. Liverpool is facing a crucial moment in relation to Gerrard. It is our goal to ensure his continued commitment to the club in the long run. I am optimistic that he will not depart the club for a minimal fee, as Michael Owen did."
1128,"A budget of £50 million would realistically enable Rafa to fully overhaul the squad. Yet, if we can manage to do this while retaining Gerrard, it would be beneficial for us. Personally, I would be satisfied with Gerrard's sale for any amount exceeding £35 million. Parry's remarks are shrewd as they ensure that any potential Gerrard transfer in the future cannot be seen as a lack of ambition by the club to retain their top players. Increasing the stakes is another astute decision by Parry."
1129,"I believe Gerrard should stay. His passion for the club and drive to succeed are irreplaceable, regardless of the offer. The crucial factor is Gerrard's happiness; if he expresses discontent, it would be unwise not to consider selling him. The concern lies in finding a suitable replacement, especially if Champions League football is not guaranteed."

This transformation is occurring as cybercriminals with advanced technological skills are utilizing technology to deceive individuals into giving up money, stealing important data, or gaining control over personal computers. The trend is shifting away from viruses designed to make a big impact by infecting a large number of devices. Instead, malicious programs are now being specifically created for criminal purposes, prompting companies to enhance network security measures to counter the emerging threat of malicious code."
1536,"The rise in criminal use of malware has blurred the lines between different types of viruses and malicious programs. Previously, viruses could be categorized based on their spreading method and infection techniques. However, modern criminal viruses combine various technical tricks into a single malicious package, making traditional categorization challenging. According to Pete Simpson, head of the threat laboratory at Clearswift, viruses now spread autonomously like worms, exploit browser vulnerabilities, or hide in email attachments. This shift towards criminality is attributed to the availability of technical experts in Eastern Europe who create customized malware for cash-rich organized gangs. Marek Strihavka"

1622,"Soon, viewers may receive rewards for watching TV as loyalty cards make their way to the screen. Sky-connected households could soon utilize smartcards alongside their set-top boxes. Broadcasters like Sky and ITV might give viewers loyalty points for tuning into a specific channel or show. According to New Media Age, Sky will enable an extra slot on set-top boxes in January."
1623,"Sky set-top boxes come with two slots, one for the decryption card and the other previously unused. Loyalty cards have become a popular addition to wallets, as retail brands offer incentives to retain customers. Similar loyalty schemes are now being introduced in the competitive world of multi-channel TV. Viewers who remain loyal to a specific channel may receive free TV content or gifts from retail partners. Broadcasters targeting children could provide smartcards for exclusive content and clubs. Nigel Whalley, managing director of media consultancy Decipher, suggested that parents could purchase prepaid cards for TV content, similar to TV pocket money cards."
1624,"Mr. Whalley mentioned that viewers might receive rewards for watching ad breaks, with concepts like ad bingo being suggested by companies looking to profit from the new market. He also discussed the potential use of chipped credit cards in set-top boxes for payment of movies, gambling, and gaming. Mr. Whalley highlighted the numerous possibilities offered by the idea of an intelligent card in boxes, emphasizing the importance of creativity from content providers.

1625,"Initially, there was the simple home video, followed by the DVD, and now Hollywood is gearing up for the next big thing in home entertainment - high-definition. High-definition offers stunning, 3D-like visuals and immersive surround sound. Although the DVD discs and necessary equipment won't be available for another year or so, there are still several issues to be addressed. However, once high-definition movies are released on the new format DVDs, it will revolutionize home entertainment. Rick Dean, the director of business development at digital content company THX, is excited about the high-definition future. Having worked on"
1626,"The current technology we are working with has resulted in a strong connection between different aspects. ""The films we watch in theaters are derived from the same digital file used for home video masters,"" he explains. However, transferring a feature film master onto a DVD involves significant compression due to the limitations of current DVD technology in accommodating the high data demands of high-definition films. ""The more you compress the picture data rate, the more you compromise the quality of the image that we strive to maintain in the master,"" he elaborates. ""I am eager to showcase the true appearance of the projects we have worked on"
1627,"Transitioning to high-definition will bring about changes for those working behind the scenes as well. In general, creating films for high-definition DVDs will be somewhat simpler because there will be less need for compression. This could also lead to Hollywood studios requesting more content to be included on the average DVD. Currently, the compression required for DVDs is quite significant, at around 98%, due to the data rates being much higher during the mastering process. With the increased capacity of high-definition DVDs, studios could potentially add more marketing material, games, and features. While skipping the down-converting step may save time,"
1628,"Scans of a corridor on the Death Star reveal a file cabinet hidden behind one of the doorways, which was not visible before due to blurriness during the pan. The advent of high-definition technology is blurring the line between home entertainment and cinema, as home theatre systems transform living rooms into movie theaters. This shift may also lead to changes in how films are accessed and in what format. Mr. Dean predicts a future where films are delivered via internet protocol for a DVD-like experience, but for now, many still prefer physical copies to display on their bookshelves."

1811,"The two high-speed elevators in the world's tallest building have been officially acknowledged as the fastest on the planet. These elevators can transport passengers to the top of the 508m tall TFC 101 Tower in Taipei, Taiwan in just 30 seconds. The Guinness Book of Records has confirmed that the speed of 17m per second of these two elevators is the quickest worldwide. Additionally, the elevators are equipped with a pressure control system to prevent passengers' ears from popping during the rapid ascent and descent."
1812,"The TFC Tower boasts a total of 61 lifts, with 34 of them being double-deckers, along with 50 escalators to transport people across its 106 floors. The official opening of the TFC 101 Tower is scheduled for December 31st. The high-speed lifts can whisk up to 24 passengers to the tower's peak in approximately 30 seconds, traveling along their 382m track. The lifts can reach a top speed of 17m/s, equivalent to about 38mph (61km/h). Interestingly, the descent takes longer, with the lifts"

The elevators were installed to reduce the whistling noise caused by their high-speed operation in a narrow shaft. The first record for the world's fastest passenger elevators was set in 1955, with a speed of 426m per minute. Hein Le Roux, a specialist researcher at Guinness World Records, noted that the new record speed is more than double that, showing significant technological advancement over the past "
1815,"In the final months of 2004, the Chinese government announced the closure of 12,575 internet cafes, citing illegal operations as the primary reason. The majority of these cafes were shut down for violating regulations, particularly those concerning their proximity to schools. This action is part of the government's ongoing efforts to regulate internet usage, which it deems immoral."
1816,"According to the official Xinhua News Agency, the crackdown was implemented to establish a ""safer environment for young people in China"". Regulations put in place in 2002 require that internet cafes be situated at least 200 meters away from middle and elementary schools. The usage hours for children at internet cafes are also closely monitored. China has expressed concerns about the negative impact of internet cafes on young individuals for a long time. Over 12,000 cafes were closed down between October and December. China also aims to control the types of computer games available to limit exposure to violence. Internet cafes are popular"
1817,"The European Parliament has rejected a bill that sought to permit the patenting of software. The decision was unanimous among politicians, and the bill will now undergo further consultation before potentially becoming law. This consultation process may involve significant revisions or even the complete abandonment of the software patents bill. Despite being supported by certain high-tech companies, who argued that the bill provided necessary protections to incentivize research, it was ultimately dismissed by the Parliament."
1818,"According to Hugo Lueders, the European director for public policy at CompTIA, the prosperity of European inventors hinges on the adequate protection of intellectual property. He noted that the benefits of the bill had been overshadowed by special interest groups, complicating the discussion on software patents. Supporters of the bill viewed it as a reasonable compromise that steered clear of the extremes seen in the American system, where business practices and software can be patented. However, opponents argued that the bill could impede innovation, be misused by companies seeking to maintain monopolies, and hinder the growth of the open"
1819,"The FBI has issued a warning about a computer virus being spread through emails that claim to be from the FBI. The emails appear to come from an fbi.gov address and falsely inform recipients that they have visited illegal websites. The messages state that the FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center has monitored their internet activity. The email includes an attachment containing the virus, which the FBI advises recipients not to open. The attachment is disguised as a questionnaire about internet use but actually infects the recipient's computer with a virus. The FBI has not specified the effects of the virus once it infects a computer. Users are"
1820,"In a statement, the FBI informed that individuals who receive such solicitations or similar ones should be aware that the FBI does not send unsolicited emails to the public in this fashion. The bureau is currently looking into the fraudulent emails. Earlier this month, the agency closed down fbi.gov accounts, which are typically used for public communication, due to a security breach. A spokeswoman mentioned that the two incidents seem to be unrelated."
1821,"A group of researchers from the United States has demonstrated that the ability to control devices using the brain is becoming more achievable. In a recent study, four individuals, including two wheelchair users with partial paralysis, were able to successfully manipulate a computer cursor by wearing a cap equipped with 64 electrodes. Previous research has shown that monkeys can also control computers using electrodes implanted in their brains. The findings of the New York team were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. According to Jonathan Wolpaw and Dennis McFarlane, the results indicate that individuals can be trained to utilize electroencephal"
1822,"Four individuals were in front of a large video screen, wearing a special cap that eliminated the need for surgery or implantation. The cap allowed for the reading of brain activity through electrical signals detected by electrodes. These signals were then translated into commands for the computer using complex algorithms. This method of brain control did not rely on nerves or muscles, making it suitable for individuals with stroke or spinal cord injuries. The researchers noted that the successful non-invasive control achieved in the study could potentially be used for operating a robotic arm, a motorized wheelchair, or a neuroprosthesis. The volunteers demonstrated improvement"
1823,"The film industry has launched a new wave of lawsuits against file-sharing networks in the US. The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has announced the closure of LokiTorrent, a network that utilized the BitTorrent peer-to-peer system. This marks the latest crackdown by the MPAA on similar networks worldwide, with legal action initiated in December across multiple continents. A Dallas court granted Hollywood lawyers access to LokiTorrent's server records to identify users sharing files illegally. By October 2004, the site had linked to over 30,000 files. Following a settlement with the MPAA, the operators"
1824,"In addition to initiating numerous legal actions across the US, the MPAA has issued ""take down"" notices to operators hosting eDonkey servers. Hollywood studios are cracking down on individuals who violate copyright laws by sharing films and TV shows online after copying them. They are now targeting operators of BitTorrent networks and have filed 100 lawsuits against them since December. The strategy aims to disrupt file-sharers' ability to exchange content through BitTorrent systems by going after server operators linking to copyrighted material. The film industry is concerned about the billions lost annually due to the black market for pirated videos and DVDs"
1825,"Gadgets are now more affordable, compact, and widespread than ever before. However, this also means that the likelihood of misplacing them has increased. A recent survey revealed that in London alone, over the past six months, more than 63,000 mobile phones were forgotten in the back of black cabs, averaging about three phones per cab. Additionally, during the same period, nearly 5,000 laptops and 5,800 PDAs like Palms and Pocket PCs were left behind in licensed cabs. Not even prominent individuals are exempt from losing their cherished gadgets. For instance,"
1826,"Londoners, along with those using cabs in the capital, have been identified as the most prone to losing laptops globally, as per research conducted by the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association and Pointsec, a mobile-data backup company. The study revealed that more than twice the number of laptops were forgotten in the back of black cabs in London compared to the other cities included in the research (Helsinki, Oslo, Munich, Paris, Stockholm, Copenhagen, Chicago, and Sydney). Conversely, Danes were found to be the most likely to misplace their mobile phones, being seven times more inclined to leave"

1833,"The Grand Theft Auto series has consistently set high standards in recent years, and the latest addition, GTA: San Andreas for the PlayStation 2, not only lives up to this tradition but also surpasses it. While it could have taken the easy route of sticking to a successful formula, the game instead significantly enhances and expands upon its predecessors. It confidently outshines competitors like Driv3r and True Crime, and even in a year with anticipated sequels to Halo and Half-Life, it is difficult to imagine anything surpassing this exceptional instant classic."
1834,"The core gameplay remains unchanged. You take on the role of CJ, a young character, embarking on a series of missions in a vast 3D world. CJ can hijack various vehicles, ranging from bicycles to buses to planes, to navigate the challenging urban environment and seek revenge for the injustices against his family. Upon arriving in town, he is falsely accused of murder and coerced by corrupt cops portrayed by Samuel L Jackson and Chris Penn. The game is set in the fictional state of San Andreas, featuring three major cities: Los Santos (Los Angeles), San Fierro (San"
1835,"In a time when games are once again facing criticism for their perceived influence on young people, the violence in San Andreas, particularly the player's freedom to engage in violent acts, is likely to provoke those in favor of censorship. Rockstar developers have not shied away from brutality and have even increased it compared to their previous games. For example, when hijacking a car, the protagonist CJ will aggressively push the driver's head into the steering wheel instead of simply taking the vehicle. The game's tone is darker than the more light-hearted Vice City, with its serious subject matter not lending itself to humor"
1836,"A US airline attendant, known as Queen of the Sky or Ellen Simonetti, is in a battle to keep her job after being suspended for her blog posts. Her blog, which was an anonymous semi-fictional account of her experiences in the sky, led to her suspension by Delta Airlines when she posted pictures of herself in uniform. The airline cited the images as ""inappropriate,"" resulting in Ms. Simonetti being suspended indefinitely without pay. Delta Airlines has chosen not to provide any further comments on the matter."
1837,"Ms Simonetti expressed her surprise and lack of warning to BBC News Online, stating that she never expected to face consequences for her blog without prior communication. The situation has raised concerns within the blogging community regarding conflicts of interest, employment regulations, and freedom of speech on personal websites. Following her suspension on 25 September, Ms Simonetti filed a complaint with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Delta Airlines declined to comment on internal employee matters when approached by BBC News Online. Ms Simonetti began her blog in January as a way to cope with her mother's passing, taking care not to"

I thought it would be fun to include them on my blog,"" Ms. Simonetti explained. She clarified that she never intended to harm her company and is puzzled by their perception that it did. Ms. Simonetti mentioned that images of male Delta Airline employees in uniform can be found online. Out of the approximately 10 images on the site, only one displayed Ms. Simonetti's flight ""wings"". She expressed uncertainty about which pictures caused the issue, but"
1839,"The Mac mini has received a warm reception from Apple enthusiasts, industry professionals, and PC users. The introduction of this compact, affordable device is considered a strategic move for Apple, as the company currently holds a small portion of the desktop computer market. Observers of the Mac ecosystem and certain analysts believe that the Mac mini will significantly enhance Apple's appeal to a broader audience. They predict that the Mac mini will be popular among iPod owners and individuals seeking a user-friendly and manageable second home computer."
1840,"Jonny Evans, the news editor at Macworld magazine, described the new product as the boldest move yet by the company. He highlighted the attractive combination of affordability, compact size, and the large user base of iPod owners, suggesting that it has the potential to be highly successful. Evans believed that the device would appeal to Apple enthusiasts who were previously deterred by the high prices of the company's hardware. He emphasized the affordability of the product and the security benefits of Apple technology, noting that it is virus-free. Evans mentioned that even his friends who own PCs were considering purchasing the new device."
1841,"Nick Ross, deputy labs editor at PC Pro, expressed his belief that the Mac mini is a good idea primarily due to its affordability, even for a PC. He also noted that Apple's focus on user-friendly design would attract fans to the Mac mini. According to him, people now expect technology to work seamlessly, and the Mac mini meets that expectation. Ross suggested that the Mac mini could serve as a convenient second computer for households, offering easy installation and management. He emphasized that the Mac mini is suitable for basic tasks like web browsing and email. Ian Fogg, a broadband and personal technology analyst"
1842,"His main concern was how user-friendly the Mac mini would be for consumers who did not own iPods. He mentioned that those who wanted to use the Mac mini with old computer peripherals might find it strange to have such a small device next to a large monitor. He suggested that most people would likely pair the Mac mini with a flat panel monitor, which would increase the overall cost. People who already had flat screens and LCD monitors were unlikely to be in the market for a new computer. There were also doubts about whether the Mac mini would be compatible with very old peripherals like displays, keyboards, and mice"

According to MessageLabs, the number of phishing e-mails intercepted has surged by over ten times within a year, with more than 18 million phishing e-mails detected in 2004. Additionally, data reveals that 73% of all e-mails in 2004 were spam, and one out of every 16 messages contained a virus."
1844,"According to MessageLabs' annual report, phishing has emerged as the primary security threat and preferred method of attack for cyber criminals. In September 2003, MessageLabs detected just 273 phishing emails attempting to lure individuals to counterfeit versions of legitimate banking and financial websites. However, by September 2004, the company was intercepting over two million phishing-related emails each month. The firm expressed concern that phishing groups were employing more sophisticated tactics to gather valuable information, such as login credentials and personal data. While earlier phishing schemes relied on users failing to recognize fake websites, recent phishing emails aim to"

1848,"Google has introduced a new trial tool that has raised concerns among some internet users because it automatically directs users to specific commercial websites. The AutoLink feature, included in Google's latest toolbar, adds links to Amazon.com when it detects a book's ISBN number on a webpage. It also links to Google Maps for addresses and to Carfax for license plates. Google claims that the feature, currently available only in the US, provides helpful links. However, some users worry that Google's strong presence in the search engine market could potentially give an advantage to companies like Amazon."
1849,"AutoLink functions by generating a hyperlink to a website based on the content of a webpage, even if no hyperlink is explicitly provided and regardless of the page publisher's authorization. When a user activates the AutoLink feature in the Google toolbar, a webpage containing a book's unique ISBN number will automatically link to Amazon's website. This could result in online libraries that display ISBN book numbers inadvertently directing users to Amazon.com. Furthermore, websites that have paid for advertisements on their pages might unintentionally steer visitors towards competing services. Dan Gillmor, the founder of Grassroots Media, a supporter of citizen-based media,"
1850,"Some users have likened the new tool to Microsoft's Smart Tags feature. However, it faced widespread criticism from internet users and was eventually discontinued by Microsoft due to trademark concerns. Smart Tags enabled Microsoft to link words on a webpage to other sites selected by the company. Google clarified that none of the companies benefiting from AutoLinks had paid for the service. Certain users argued that AutoLink would be more acceptable if websites had to opt in for the feature to work on their pages or if they received compensation for any clicks leading to a commercial site. Cory Doctorow, the European outreach coordinator for the Electronic Frontier"
1851,"For those who have avoided using free peer-to-peer services, downloading music can be an expensive endeavor. Even paying just 70p per track can quickly accumulate, especially for individuals with modern music players capable of storing numerous songs. The traditional method of paying per track for music is becoming outdated, similar to paying per minute for internet access. Instead, alternative subscription models are emerging as a more convenient and cost-effective way to own music in the long run."
1852,"Paul Myers, CEO of Wippit, a UK music download service, noted that music fans are shifting away from purchasing traditional albums containing a dozen or more songs. Instead, they are opting for single tracks or subscription services that better suit their lifestyle. While iTunes is successful in selling individual tracks to iPod users, there is a debate on whether owning music is still relevant in the digital era. Napster is set to introduce a new rental subscription service called Napster to Go in the UK soon, compatible with players supporting Microsoft Windows' latest Digital Rights Management technology, Janus. This includes devices from Samsung"
1853,"Some digital music enthusiasts are upset by this development, particularly because Napster already provides a more affordable option for downloading music to computers. Napster argues that the higher price is due to record labels charging more for the on-the-go service and asserts that it delivers ""greater value"" to customers. Mr. Myers is skeptical about the viability of a rental model for consumers. ""We have been offering our unlimited music subscription service for over three years, and our customers have clear preferences. They value format compatibility, great pricing, and the assurance that music bought from Wippit belongs to them and can be enjoyed"
1854,"Apple has introduced a new affordable Macintosh computer called the Mac mini for the general public. During his annual MacWorld presentation in San Francisco, CEO Steve Jobs showcased the new device. Priced at $499 in the US and £339 in the UK, Jobs referred to the Macintosh as the most significant Mac produced by Apple. Additionally, Jobs revealed the iPod shuffle, a new music player that utilizes less expensive flash memory instead of the pricier hard drives found in other iPod models."
1855,"The company's new computer marks a shift into uncharted territory, as it is traditionally recognized as a design and innovation-focused firm rather than a mass-market manufacturer. The Mac mini is sold without a monitor, keyboard, and mouse, with a larger hard drive version also available for $599. Set to be released on January 22nd, the machine, dubbed ""BYODKM"" by Jobs, aims to attract Windows PC users looking to switch operating systems. Jobs emphasized that it is the most affordable and newest Mac ever, eliminating excuses for those considering a change. The computer, which has been the"
1856,"""They are interested in trying out the Mac further because they are impressed by what they have seen with the iPod,"" Harris commented. ""Many believed that Apple was content with being a niche producer of high-end computers, so entering a market dominated by low-cost manufacturers like Dell is a bold move. However, it demonstrates Apple's desire to build on the widespread success it has achieved with the iPod. The Mac mini will attract PC users seeking an appealing, hassle-free computer."" The new iPod shuffle is available in two versions: one with 512mb of storage for $99 (£69 in the UK) and"
1857,"The high-tech sector is becoming increasingly conscious of the environment, a development that Bill Thompson believes is long overdue. When I first started driving, my car ran on four-star petrol and emitted large amounts of lead into the air as I navigated the streets of Cambridge. Nowadays, lead additives in petrol are no longer available, leading to overall benefits for everyone. Additionally, tech giant Intel has recently started distributing computer circuit boards that are free of lead, showcasing a heightened awareness within the industry that products must be created and manufactured in more eco-friendly ways."
1858,"In addition to reducing the use of toxic materials such as arsenic, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals in products, efforts are being made to clean up the manufacturing process by using fewer complex and potentially harmful organic chemicals as solvents. There is also a focus on developing more energy-efficient power supplies to address the wastefulness of current transformers that charge electronic devices like laptops, mobiles, and music players. A key aspect of the new approach is designing products that are easier to recycle. Extracting toxic chemicals or heavy metals from phones or computers can be difficult and costly, but well-designed"
1859,"If they construct things that are costly or difficult to dismantle, they will ultimately incur expenses and see their profits decline. This is likely to serve as a motivation for them, whereas appeals to the broader public interest may not have the same impact. It is high time for a change. Throughout history, we have a troubling track record of developing new technologies without considering their environmental impact, only addressing the issue when a crisis is imminent. Take the car engine, for example: lead additives were used to prevent premature ignition in the cylinder, known as 'knocking', without much thought given to the lead ending up"
1860,"After surveying my office, I discovered two monitors, an outdated 386 PC, two old handheld devices, three ancient laptops, four vintage mobile phones, a selection of rechargeable batteries, and a Sun workstation that is no longer of much use. These items are all old enough to be considered hazardous waste, particularly the monitors which contain arsenic and lead. While some components may still have utility, I am hesitant to dispose of them properly by taking them to the council recycling center, as it is a 10-mile drive across town and, like many others, my dedication to recycling is lacking."
1861,"Analysts predict that Asia will drive global media growth beyond 2008, with China and India leading the way. Japan, South Korea, and Singapore are also expected to be significant players, but China's demographics give it a competitive advantage. With a population of 1.3 billion, China now has around 200 million middle-class consumers, with 40% falling in the key 16 to 35-year-old demographic. This has led to a surge in foreign investment in media and communications in China, attracting interest from international media groups such as News Corporation, Viacom, and Sony Pictures,"
1862,"Over 700 million Chinese tune in to 1,000 radio stations, and 200 TV stations air 2,900 channels. China Central Television (CCTV), the state broadcaster, claims an audience of over a billion people. Out of the country's 360 million households, 100 million have access to cable TV programs. The remaining households could potentially become viewers of satellite broadcasting, which China plans to introduce in 2006. The State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television (SARFT), responsible for regulating broadcasting, aims to transition all programs to digital format by 201"
1863,"Chinese and foreign entrepreneurs are eyeing opportunities in new media such as mobile services and online gaming, in addition to traditional broadcasting. Mobile games currently contribute 15% of revenues from China's 340 million mobile users, with online gaming sales expected to exceed a billion US dollars next year. Despite high piracy levels, the video market is considered a lucrative sector, while the cinema industry is rapidly adopting digital screens to modernize venues, combat piracy, and regulate distribution.

The European consortium Respond, comprised of companies and university groups, is working to create accurate and current maps to help overcome the significant logistical challenges of delivering supplies to those in need. By utilizing satellite imagery, Respond is able to quickly produce detailed maps of road networks, rivers, and villages, as well as larger-scale maps for general planning purposes. Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, a UN satellite mapping organization within the"
1865,"The group utilizes satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency, and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is sent to ground stations and then forwarded to Respond organizations that specialize in interpreting such data. Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of these organizations, the German Aerospace Centre, explained, ""The data must be converted into images, and then the interpreter must translate this into crisis, damage, or situation maps."" This detailed analysis typically takes a few months, but Respond manages to complete it in about 12 hours. Mr. Voigt added, ""Our users"
1866,"Humanitarian organizations in Darfur have been effectively utilizing Respond's maps, particularly during Sudan's rainy season. The maps have been particularly useful when the normally dry riverbeds, known as wadis, became flooded. Stephen Candillon from Respond's imaging partner Sertit explained that while the flooding in the wadis was not significant in terms of depth, it significantly hindered the transportation capabilities of the humanitarian groups on the field. Respond's quick imaging technology enabled aid groups to navigate around the flooded wadis and mark on their maps which roads were affected by the flooding at specific times."
1867,"When you tune into radio stations in the US, you'll likely hear a lot of Spanish-language music, but Spanish-language hip-hop is not as common. Despite the popularity of hip-hop and rap in the Spanish-speaking world, local artists face challenges in promoting their music internationally. However, a US company is now making Spanish-language rap and hip-hop accessible to computer users worldwide. Los Caballeros de Plan G, one of Mexico's top hip-hop groups, have a strong following in their hometown of Monterrey. Unfortunately, most Mexican hip-hop fans, as well as fans across the Spanish-speaking world"
1868,"Manuel Millan, a San Diego native, explains that accessing Spanish hip-hop on mainstream radio is difficult due to its lack of availability. The commercialized sound and limited recognition of Spanish hip-hop groups make it challenging for them to reach a wider audience. To address this issue, Millan and his friends decided to promote groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G globally. Since mainstream radio stations were not an option and starting their own broadcast station was not feasible, they launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. This web-based radio platform exclusively features the latest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks"
1869,"Spanish language hip-hop is gaining momentum on the web, with artists like Mustafa Yoda from Argentina and the Chilean group Makisa making waves on latinohiphopradio.com. According to Millan, Mustafa Yoda is considered the Eminem of Argentina and is poised to become a major player in the Spanish-speaking world. The site, which has been live for a few months, has attracted listeners from various Spanish-speaking countries, with Mexico leading the pack.

The DS is Nintendo's flagship product in its efforts to maintain its leading position in the handheld gaming market."
1872,"After being released in Japan and the US in late 2004, Nintendo has sold nearly 4 million DS consoles. The DS's appeal may stem from its ability to play any of the 700 games available for Nintendo's GameBoy Advance handheld. DS games are anticipated to be priced between £19 and £29, with approximately 130 new games currently in the works."
1873,"In addition to featuring two screens, one of which is touch-controlled, the DS allows players to engage with up to 16 others wirelessly. Through the ""download play"" option, DS owners can compete against each other even if only one of them possesses a copy of a specific game. Furthermore, DS users can exchange text messages and drawings. Nintendo is also preparing to launch a media adapter for the handheld device, enabling it to play music and videos.

This tactic is employed to evade detection by antivirus programs that scan email attachments for malicious code."
1898,"The virus known as Bofra utilizes a specific technique, with the first worm of its kind appearing on 10 November. It takes advantage of a recently discovered Windows vulnerability. Similar to other contemporary viruses, Bofra extracts email addresses from the Microsoft Outlook address book and searches through other files on the infected device for additional targets. The virus employs its own email sending software to send messages to potential victims, but it does not spread through email itself. Instead, the emails contain deceptive web links that redirect back to the originating machine when clicked. Essentially, Bofra transforms infected devices into miniature web servers"
1899,"The BBC News website displayed messages with bright yellow and green backgrounds, which, when clicked on, unintentionally led to the download of the Bofra virus. This virus then searches for new addresses to propagate itself. Clearswift, a filtering firm, explained that this virus spreads quickly by creating numerous mini web servers to avoid being shut down.

1998,"How about the magnetic compass? It's been in use for 1,000 years since its invention. I find it fascinating how people are more focused on specific gadgets rather than broader categories. Take the Sony Walkman, for instance, which revolutionized portable music listening, while devices like Minidiscs, Flash MP3 players, and portable CD players are simply technological advancements."
1999,"I really enjoy using my portable MiniDisc player and the battery-powered frother for my coffee. However, I have to question any list that ranks the Taser as one of the top 100 gadgets."
2000,"There is no doubt that the Swiss army knife is a timeless classic. How many other items have remained true to their original concept and are still as practical and popular? You don't need a laptop or even a pocket calculator to figure that out! This comparison highlights the cultural differences between American and British perspectives. Brits tend to mention mobile phones and the Sinclair for those over thirty, while Americans mention Apple, TV remotes, and TiVO (which may not be as well-known in Europe)."
2001,"Have you tried the Soda Stream? This device completely transformed my pre-teen years. While laptops may encourage innovative thinking, they can't provide the same fizzy fun as the Soda Stream. Remember Astro Wars, one of the early computer games? I used to spend hours playing it, and it still functions perfectly today. I recently gave it a try again, but it didn't live up to my memories. Nonetheless, it remains a fantastic gadget from its era."
2002,"Why be concerned about mobile phones when they will soon be integrated into PDAs, laptops, and other devices? Consider the Marine Chronometer, which transformed boat navigation for centuries and was a remarkable technological advancement of its era."
2003,The Sony Net Minidisc was a trailblazer that led to the proliferation of MP3 players in the market. I relied on my NetMD and never left home without it. A laptop is more than just a gadget - it's an essential tool for work.
2004,"The Sinclair Executive was the first pocket calculator in the world. I believe it should be included. What about the clockwork radio? Or GPS? Or even a pocket calculator? These items are beneficial to everyday individuals, not just PC magazine editors."
2005,"Do the individuals responsible for compiling this list lack sanity? Undoubtedly, the mobile phone stands out as the most crucial device of the contemporary era. It has transformed communication, a feat that cannot be attributed to a specialized laptop. Looking back from a historical perspective, the marine chronometer emerges as the paramount gadget, essential for the rapid evolution of modern transportation systems. But has everyone overlooked the Breville pie maker?"
2006,"A fascinating compilation. In the early 1980s, numerous journalists praised the original Tandy 100 notebook PC as an innovative electronic gadget. It was the size of A4 paper, lightweight, had a long battery life of three weeks, an excellent keyboard, and a modem. It was unfortunate that Tandy did not make it compatible with DOS. What about the Apple Powerbook 100? It is considered outdated and not much of a ""gadget."" Perhaps simplicity and timelessness are better represented by items like a tin opener, Swiss Army Knife, safety razor blade, wristwatch, or"
2007,"The mobile phone stands out as the most impactful device in our daily lives, with no other single gadget having such a significant influence in such a brief period. The ballpoint pen is undoubtedly one of the most widely utilized and familiar tools. Additionally, many appreciate the pocket calculator for its substantial advancement over the slide rule."
2008,"In 1980, the Casio pocket calculator, which featured a basic game and emitted small sounds, was a popular gadget. It was a portable item that could be flaunted. The top 10 items on the list are all electronic toys, indicating a strong focus on high-tech devices. This is evident as the Swiss Army Knife only ranked at No. 20."
2009,"The Sinclair QL was an innovative machine that was ahead of its time, being the first home computer with a true multitasking operating system. Unfortunately, its potential was hindered by poor marketing. On the other hand, Apple products are often seen as a triumph of style over substance."
2010,"Describing the sextant and marine chronometer as 'gadgets' and ranking them lower in importance than a TV remote control shows a lack of historical perspective. The former significantly improved navigation at sea, while the latter contributed to the development of couch potato culture. In terms of portable computing, the Apple Newton, first Palm Pilot, and possibly the Toshiba Libretto are frontrunners. It's a shame that the Flipstart from Vulcan Inc is only vaporware, as it would likely be at the top."
2011,"How did a laptop surpass the competition posed by wristwatches, telephones (mobile or otherwise), radios, TVs, and the Swiss army knife? I acquired my Swiss army knife 12 years ago, and it remains incredibly useful, enduring the passage of time while still being frequently utilized."
2012,"The Psion Organiser series 3 deserves recognition for its impressive features, including a practical qwerty keyboard, removable storage, a variety of useful apps, and programmability. The innovative design, with batteries located in the hinge, was a standout feature. This pioneering mobile PC was voted the best gadget by readers of a mobile PC publication, but the validity of such biased lists is questionable. A more impartial source would likely reveal that mobile phones or remote controls are the true favorites among consumers."
2013,"The Motorola Startac deserves the top spot. Why? Mobile phones will outlast notebook computers and other gadgets, as they will eventually be integrated into communication devices. The Psion series 3c is the most convenient way to store all your information on the go."
2014,"I also support the Sinclair Spectrum - without this amazing device, I would have never entered the IT field and achieved the career I have today. I would have likely prioritized a Nokia mobile phone as well."
2015,"The Sinclair Spectrum - 16k connected to the television. Although the games were not great, it sparked my interest in programming, which is now my profession. I hope that modern laptops, including Apple's latest models, would take inspiration from the PB100. It is disappointing to see the disappearance of the trackball, replaced by the less effective ""trackpad"" found in all current laptops. These trackpads are typically imprecise, uncomfortable, and difficult to use."
2016,Kudos to Apple for a well-earned victory!
2017,"With digital TV, DVDs, and digital video recorders now widely embraced by a significant number of people, the television industry is gearing up for the next big revolution in TV technology. High-definition (HDTV) is being touted as the most significant development in television since the introduction of color. HD offers TV viewers a picture quality that is at least four times better than what is currently available. However, there is growing concern that consumers are not receiving accurate information about HD when shopping in stores. Many flat panel screens, including LCDs, plasma screens, and DLP rear-projection TV sets, have"

Alexander Oudendijk, senior vice president of marketing for satellite giant Astra, mentioned that there are 74 devices being sold as HD but are not HD-ready. These TVs lack DVI or HDMI connectors needed to handle higher resolution digital images. Industry experts, who gathered at Bafta in London for the 2nd European HDTV Summit, highlighted the"
2019,"Preparations are currently in progress in certain regions for the transition to digital broadcasting, and programming is being recorded using HD cameras. BSkyB is planning to release its initial set of set-top boxes capable of receiving HDTV broadcasts in time for the holiday season. These boxes, similar to the Sky+ models, will also function as personal video recorders (PVRs). The company intends to launch HDTV broadcasts as ""premium channel packages"" in early 2006, focusing initially on sports, major events, and movies. However, for HDTV to be truly experienced, the set-top"
2020,"Starting next month, all devices meeting the necessary connector and resolution requirements will feature an ""HD-Ready"" sticker, indicating their ability to handle both analogue and HDTV signals and meeting the industry's minimum standards. David Mercer, an analyst at Strategy Analytics, expressed support for the logo, but noted its limited presence on retail products. While the industry sees the sticker as a positive step, there is acknowledgment that more needs to be done. Mr. Oudendijk emphasized the constraints faced by manufacturers and the potential for dissatisfied customers in the near future. The European Broadcast Union (EBU) is"
2021,"The Legal Affairs Committee of the European Parliament has requested a revision of the proposals for controversial new European Union regulations governing computer-based inventions. The committee, known as JURI, has asked the Commission to resubmit the Computer Implemented Inventions Directive after it failed to receive support from MEPs. Critics argue that the directive may benefit large companies over small ones and could have a negative impact on innovation in open-source software. Proponents believe that it would enable companies to safeguard their inventions. The directive aims to provide patent protection for inventions that utilize software to achieve their purpose, known as ""computer implemented inventions."""
2022,"Critics of the draft directive were pleased with the decision and believed that a new first reading of the proposals would allow for more extensive discussions on its implications across all member states. In the United States, the patenting of computer programs and internet business methods is allowed. For instance, the US-based Amazon.com has a patent for its ""one-click shopping"" service. Critics fear that the directive could pave the way for a similar system in Europe, potentially disadvantaging small software developers who lack the legal and financial resources to defend against patent lawsuits in court. Supporters argue that the current laws are ineffective and"
2023,"A report by analysts Forrester Research predicts that the global number of personal computers will double to 1.3 billion by 2010. The growth is expected to be fueled by emerging markets like China, Russia, and India, with over a third of new PCs being in these regions. Forrester anticipates that China will add 178 million new PCs by 2010, with local companies producing low-priced computers dominating the market. This report follows IBM's recent sale of its PC hardware division to China's leading computer manufacturer, Lenovo."
2024,"The $1.75 billion (ÃÂ£900 million) agreement will result in the combined entity becoming the third largest PC vendor worldwide. Simon Yates, a senior analyst at Forrester, noted that Western PC vendors' current products may not maintain dominance in the long run. Instead, local PC manufacturers like Lenovo Group in China and Aquarius in Russia, who can better customize the PC design, pricing, and applications to suit their local markets, are likely to emerge victorious in the battle for market share. Presently, there are 575 million PCs in operation globally. The study predicts"
2025,"Two reports suggest that mobile phones are not yet equipped to fully replace portable media players as all-singing, all-dancing multimedia devices. Jupiter stated that despite efforts to introduce music download services on mobiles, consumers are hesitant to sacrifice size and battery life for additional multimedia features. Gartner's separate study also indicated that real-time TV broadcasts to mobiles in Europe are unlikely until 2007 due to unresolved technical issues and standards. The increasing demand for services like video playback, video messaging, megapixel cameras, and games is already putting strain on mobile phone batteries, and introducing music download services could further"
2026,"Half of Europeans prioritize the size of a mobile phone when selecting a device, but larger handsets are often required due to increased power demands. According to Thomas Husson, a mobile analyst at Jupiter research, mobile music services should not compete with PC music experiences as current handsets are not equipped for it. Instead, mobile music services should be innovative and distinct, allowing operators to differentiate their brands and support third generation network launches. Challenges in mobile music include limited storage on phones compared to portable players with larger capacities. The mobile industry aims to enter the music downloading market following the success of services like Apple's"
2027,"Globally, there are various standards and methods being developed to deliver TV signals to mobile devices. In Europe, trials in Berlin and Helsinki are utilizing terrestrial TV towers to transmit compressed signals to phones equipped with additional receivers. The Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation offers a service that allows individuals to watch TV programs on their mobile devices around the clock using 3GP technology, one of the mobile TV standards. However, by the end of 2004, the European Telecommunications Institute (Etsi) officially adopted Digital Video Broadcasting Handheld (DVB-H) as the standard for mobile TV broadcasting in Europe."
2028,"T-Mobile has introduced its latest third-generation (3G) ""pocket office"" device with built-in wi-fi for high-speed wireless internet access. Unlike other devices that require users to manually select the fastest network for data transfer, this device automatically chooses the quickest option.

This year, there is a trend towards TV-quality video content becoming more prevalent online, bringing TV and internet content closer together. During a debate in Westminster, industry professionals discussed potential approaches. Lord Currie, the chairman of Ofcom, emphasized the importance of safeguarding audiences as a top priority for the watchdog. While Ofcom does not currently regulate internet content, recent statements have led to concerns among internet service providers about the possibility of regulation. Lord Currie, speaking at the debate organized by the"
2035,"He mentioned that the challenge will arise when the boundaries between TV and the internet become less distinct, and a balance needs to be found between protecting consumers and allowing them to evaluate risks themselves. The discussion will involve considering whether to adopt existing rules for regulating TV content or continue with the current practice of self-regulation in the internet industry. Some studies indicate that around eight million households in the UK may have adopted broadband by the end of 2005, which will enable the delivery of TV content over the internet. An increasing number of internet service providers and media companies are streaming video content online. BT has already"
2036,"He suggested that if consumers have actively requested and downloaded content, perhaps it should be exempt from regulation. Internet service providers have historically distanced themselves from content on their servers, citing the Law Commission's classification of them as ""mere conduits"" in 2002. However, this defense does not hold if they are aware of illegal content and do not remove it. The extent of their responsibility has been tested in various legal cases. Tiscali's portal director, Richard Ayers, argued that regulating the internet would be futile due to its complexity. He anticipated significant changes in 2005, particularly"
2037,"Sun Microsystems has introduced a pay-as-you-go service that enables customers in need of substantial computing power to rent it on an hourly basis. The Sun Grid service charges users $1 for an hour's worth of processing and storage power on Sun-maintained systems. Sun views grid computing as a crucial concept, considering computing capacity as valuable as hardware and software. The company compares grid computing to the evolution of electricity."
2038,"Sun's chief operating officer, Jonathan Schwartz, suggested that the system could evolve similarly to utilities like electricity and water. During a webcast at Sun's quarterly Network Computing event in California, he questioned the need for building one's own grid when they could use Sun's for just a dollar per hour. The company will need to convince data center managers to embrace this new model, but it has already received interest from customers in the oil, gas, and financial services sectors. Some of these customers are looking to reserve computing capacity exceeding 5,000 processors each. Mr. Schwartz demonstrated the service by showcasing"

He emphasized the importance of being informed immediately if a bill exceeds the usual monthly amount, rather than being notified after it has reached a significantly higher total. Dwight also highlighted that phone companies have the necessary tools to identify fraudulent activity and abnormal call traffic, urging them to monitor and report any"
2068,"Telecoms ombudsman Elizabeth France mentioned that she wouldn't be surprised if her credit card company contacted her for unusual activity, so she expects phone companies to adopt a similar proactive approach. BT, the largest phone company, is working on monitoring fraud and alerting customers about unauthorized calls. They recommend using call barring to prevent calls to premium lines, as once the call is made, there is limited recourse. Gavin Patterson, BT Consumer's group managing director, stated that they analyze customers' calling patterns and intervene if necessary, with ongoing efforts to enhance this process. However, monitoring 180 million"
2069,"I rely on free anti-virus software (AVG) and free firewall protection (ZoneAlarm) to block unauthorized access and prevent accidental outgoing calls caused by my daughter's frequent visits to music websites. It would be helpful if Internet Service Providers (ISPs) informed all customers about these security tools. While customers are ultimately responsible for their online safety, many people unknowingly fall victim to cyber threats due to a lack of knowledge. Ignorance can be costly in the realm of cybersecurity."
2070,"Is there anyone aware of the consequences once this fraud has been committed and acknowledged? The individuals who fraudulently obtain money are paid by phone companies, so are these individuals tracked and prosecuted? These dialers are primarily downloaded from websites that offer illegal MP3s, porn, and pirated software. If individuals refrained from visiting such sites, they would be at significantly lower risk. What happened to personal accountability? It appears that everyone must play the role of a 'victim' nowadays!"
2071,"The manufacturers of home computer operating systems bear some responsibility for the issue. A secure system should prevent web pages or emails from downloading and installing anything without the user's consent. These fraudulent activities are against the law, and telephone companies should not be involved in them. They should decline to transfer funds to the criminals. Perhaps they are benefiting from the scam and that's why they are allowing it to continue."
2072,"Why not have BT and other companies automatically block all premium numbers and only unblock them upon customer request? If you are a victim of a scam, do not pay your telephone provider for these calls. Once you report the fraudulent transactions to your provider, they cannot force you to pay the bill, as doing so would be aiding the fraudsters. No customers have been taken to court for refusing to pay these bills. Consider disabling or removing your modem and using broadband instead to avoid such issues. Alternatively, invest in quality firewall software and anti-virus protection. Just as you wouldn't go out in the"
2073,"I was really impressed with the service from our phone company recently. I had been calling a hotline number for Kylie tickets multiple times, and the next day they called me back to inform me that there were around 40 calls made to the same number. It was great service, and I also managed to get the tickets! I have a colleague who experienced a similar situation with a scam. He reported it to the phone company, and they blocked premium rate numbers. However, three months later, he received another bill of over £1,000. The block didn't seem to work, and he still"
2074,"I was defrauded of £139. The operator refuses to take any action, and to make matters worse, I was charged VAT by the government. Premium rate numbers have been targeted by scams since their inception. One such scam involved setting up a premium rate number and continuously dialing it from unpaid phone lines. The telephone company fell victim to this scheme, prompting a swift closure of the loophole."
2075,"I am aware of individuals who have accumulated significant debts, despite having knowledge in IT. After speaking with BT in Belfast, I have learned that they are planning to release a free application that can prevent users from dialing costly numbers unknowingly. It is not the phone companies' fault, and it is commendable that they are taking action. It is high time that the excessive profits made by the 'legitimate' phone companies are put to an end, primarily by phasing out dial-up services and making broadband more affordable. This move will not only thwart dialer scammers but also facilitate easier and"
2076,"I have not been a victim of a rogue-dialling scam, but I believe it is important to highlight that most of these scams originate from individuals attempting to access services claiming to offer free pornography. In many instances, the user is responsible for their actions, which is likely why telephone companies are hesitant to provide refunds. My phone provider failed to notify me that my monthly bill had increased from the usual £3 to £5, to a shocking £320 due to the scam. They simply charged me without informing me. What particularly upsets me, aside from being robbed of over £300, is"
2077,"What do you think about implementing an automatic monthly limit of £20 on premium rate calls that can only be lifted by contacting your provider? This would allow you to use legitimate premium rate numbers while reducing the risk of fraudulent usage. Having a cap in place would limit any disputed charges, making it easier for telecoms operators to write off £20 rather than £750. I have personally experienced being targeted by such scams in the past, but thankfully, I had already upgraded to broadband and nothing was connected to my modem, so all I heard was the sound of an attempted connection."
2078,What if home users took on the responsibility of ensuring that their anti-virus and firewall software is kept up-to-date? This simple step could help prevent the majority of these scams.

She mentioned that Japan is currently ahead of North America and western European markets in terms of mobile technology offerings, such as TV, music, ringtones, and cameras, leading to a decline in replacement phone purchases. However, Gartner predicts a potential slowdown in sales in European and US markets as consumers wait for advancements in mobile technology. This highlights the importance for mobile companies to carefully consider their new model offerings to entice consumers to"
2084,"In 2005, the focus on design and aesthetics, as well as music services, was expected to drive sales. The Motorola Razr V3 phone exemplified the emphasis on design that would become more common that year. According to Ms. Milanesi, this trend was not limited to women but was a desire shared by both men and women to use gadgets as a form of self-expression. It was not just about the phone's functionality but also about what it communicated about its owner. Ms. Milanesi noted that Western Europe had always been a market that valued design, with people seeking"

The English-language news site has reportedly been inaccessible for the last 10 days. The watchdog claims that this move is intended to push users towards using a Chinese version of the site that allegedly censors critical reports. Google has acknowledged the issues and is currently looking into the reasons behind the blockage, according to a statement provided to the BBC News website."
2086,"China is known for having stricter internet censorship measures than any other country globally. A specialized net police force oversees online activities, monitors websites and emails, and regulates gateways connecting the nation to the worldwide web to block access to sensitive information. Major Chinese portals like Sina.com and Sohu.com closely monitor content and remove politically sensitive comments. Additionally, all 110,000 internet cafes in the country are required to utilize software that restricts access to websites deemed harmful or subversive."
2087,"The group stated that China is blocking Google News in order to push internet users to use the Chinese version of the site, which has been stripped of critical news reports. They criticized Google for agreeing to launch a news service that excludes content disliked by the government, accusing the company of allowing itself to be manipulated by Beijing. Google acknowledged the issue, stating that many users in China are experiencing difficulties accessing Google News and that they are working to address the problem. Google News compiles information from 4,500 news sources and uses a computer algorithm to select headlines without human editorial input. The service offers 15"
2088,"A recent study discovered that the inappropriate actions of email users are contributing to the longevity of the spam industry. Findings from a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group revealed that approximately 30% of email users have clicked on links in spam messages. Additionally, one out of every ten users has made purchases from products advertised in unsolicited emails. Clicking on links in spam messages can potentially expose individuals to viruses and inform spammers of active email accounts."
2089,"According to the report, the fact that one out of every ten email users is purchasing items advertised in spam emails continues to make spam a lucrative business. This is mainly due to the low cost of sending out large volumes of spam. Marcel Nienhuis, a market analyst at the Radicati Group, expressed surprise and concern over this initial data, attributing the proliferation of email security threats like spam, viruses, and phishing scams to users engaging in ""bad email behavior."" Clearswift, a security firm, noted that spammers are adapting to current trends, such as offering fake Sony PSP giveaways"

A survey conducted by the firm found that 75% of business documents contain sensitive information that firms would prefer to keep confidential. Alarmingly, 90% of the companies surveyed were unaware that their confidential information was being leaked. The report advises companies to improve their document monitoring efforts as corporate compliance requirements become more stringent."
2094,"Andrew Pearson, the European boss of Workshare, who commissioned the research, mentioned that sensitive information inadvertently leaked in documents includes confidential contractual terms, competitive information that rivals would be interested in, and special deals for key customers. He also highlighted that the efficiencies brought by the internet, such as instant access to information, have led to security and control issues. The issue is particularly problematic with documents created using Microsoft Word due to the hidden records it maintains about editing changes. As documents are circulated and edited by different staff members, sensitive information can end up in the documents. Lack of control over the editing process can"

Even when I attempt to"
2321,"I have a strong passion for online role-playing games. It's not just about completing quests, but it provides the thrill of real-life situations with goals to accomplish. I dedicate around five hours each day to playing online and often get only four to five hours of sleep before heading to work the next day. Many players choose to spend their time in MMORPGs rather than watching TV, so I don't believe it has a negative impact on their social lives. Additionally, these games offer a significant social aspect, unlike other solitary activities like watching TV or being a couch potato."
2322,"Just like with anything else, excessive gaming can be harmful. However, if you can balance it with other activities and take breaks, it can be enjoyable.

I am aware that I play for extended periods, but it has become an uncontrollable obsession. I am seeking recommendations for a counselor as I am increasingly concerned about this issue. My friend and I play online together for an hour or two each day, acknowledging the time that can slip away while gaming. Finding a balance between unwinding with gaming after a stressful day and enjoying real-life activities is a challenge."
2324,"When World of Warcraft was released, I purchased the US version and played for up to 23 hours straight at one point. I eventually stopped playing after a month due to its addictive nature, but recently caved in and bought the European version. Moving forward, I plan to be more disciplined with my gaming time. Despite being a great game, I acknowledge that MMORPGs can be all-consuming. I am particularly concerned about younger gamers who spend hours playing in an adult environment. Many MMORPGs require a credit card to play, and I don't think parents fully understand the potential risks"

Over the past two decades, mobile phones have become a crucial aspect of contemporary living, with nearly 90% of Britons now owning a handset. The popularity of mobile phones has grown to the extent that many individuals rely solely on their handset for communication and seldom use a landline."
2663,"The first call made on a portable phone was in 1973 in New York, but it took a decade for the first commercial mobile service to be launched. The UK quickly followed suit in 1985 by establishing networks that allowed people to make calls while on the move. The inaugural call was placed from St Katherine's dock to Vodafone's head office in Newbury, which was located above a curry house at the time.

It's disappointing that Vulcan Inc's Flipstart never materialized, as it could have been a top contender. How did laptops surpass the wristwatch and telephone (both mobile and landline) in terms of popularity? What about radios and TVs in this context?"
2711,"The Swiss army knife is undoubtedly the most practical tool. I acquired mine a dozen years back and it continues to be heavily utilized. It has proven its durability over time. The Psion Organiser series 3 also deserves recognition. It featured a convenient qwerty keyboard, removable storage, a variety of useful apps, and was programmable. The design of the case was well thought out, with batteries located in the hinge - a unique feature. This product truly showcased innovative design."
2712,"The initial portable computer was chosen as the top device by readers of... well... a portable computer publication?! Why do you persist in featuring these clearly biased rankings on your website? It's evident that the mobile phone or remote control should take the lead, and readers of a more impartial publication would confirm this. The Motorola Startac deserves the top spot. Why? Mobile phones will remain relevant long after notebook computers and other gadgets have either disappeared or been integrated into communication devices."
2713,"The Psion series 3c is the most practical solution for carrying all your information with you. I also support the Sinclair Spectrum, as without it, I would have never entered the field of IT and achieved the success I have today."
2714,"I would have ranked the mobile phone as a top priority, most likely a Nokia model. The Sinclair Spectrum - 16k came next, connecting to the TV. The games were not great, but they sparked my interest in programming, which is now my profession."
2715,"I hope that modern notebooks, including Apple's latest models, would take inspiration from the PB100. It's disappointing to see the disappearance of the trackball in favor of the less effective ""trackpad"" found in all current notebooks. These trackpads are typically inaccurate, uncomfortable, and awkward to use. Kudos to Apple for a well-deserved victory!"
