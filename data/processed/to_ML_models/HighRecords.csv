He aims to revolutionize podcasting and views it as an extension of his childhood passion for radio technology. Growing up in the Netherlands, he experimented with building AM and FM transmitters using a Radio Shack 101 project kit. His interest in radio led him to host pirate radio shows in Amsterdam before pursuing university studies in the US.

In addition to technical hurdles, podcasters may encounter legal obstacles when broadcasting copyrighted music.
