# Title: DupliDetect

**Abstract**
DupliDetect is a system that finds similarities among multiple documents. It uses grammatical structure to decipher the 
possibility of a submission being plagiarised or generated by AI. While it can also detect software similarity, the only language currently supported is python.

# Note 

AI content detectors are known to have high false positives which can bring upon unintended consequences if used as the sole judgement factor in deciding if someone has plagiarised content. In many cases, human discernment by a subject matter expert is necessary to truly determine the authenticity of the work.
