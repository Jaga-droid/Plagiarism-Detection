# Plagiarism-Detection
A Comparitive Study of Machine Learning-based text generation and plagiarism detection

Tools such as Turnitin are widely used by academic institutions to check for plagiarism. However, these checks are usually based on string matching algorithms which are bypassed by tools that rewrite texts and articles that still retain human-like qualities. A survey of plagiarism tools will be conducted followed by which certain aspects will be explored including the ability to leverage machine learning algorithms to generate new content based on existing training data by means of rewriting texts, reference and compare concepts as well. The goal of the project is to detect plagiarism that traditional tools like Turnitin would miss.
